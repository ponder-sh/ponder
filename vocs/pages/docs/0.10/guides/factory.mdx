# Factory pattern [Collect a dynamic list of addresses]

The factory pattern makes it possible to index a dynamic list of contracts. You can think of the `factory()` function as returning a list of addresses that updates whenever a log is found that matches the configuration.

## Basic usage

To configure a factory, use the `factory()` function as the `address` value in a contract or account. 

```ts [ponder.config.ts]
import { createConfig, factory } from "ponder"; // [!code focus]
import { parseAbiItem } from "viem";
import { SudoswapPoolAbi } from "./abis/SudoswapPool";

export default createConfig({
  networks: { /* ... */ },
  contracts: {
    SudoswapPool: {
      abi: SudoswapPoolAbi,
      network: "mainnet",
      address: factory({ // [!code focus]
        // Address of the factory contract. // [!code focus]
        address: "0xb16c1342E617A5B6E4b631EB114483FDB289c0A4", // [!code focus]
        // Event from the factory contract ABI which contains the child address. // [!code focus]
        event: parseAbiItem("event NewPair(address poolAddress)"), // [!code focus]
        // Name of the event parameter containing the child address. // [!code focus]
        parameter: "poolAddress", // [!code focus]
      }), // [!code focus]
      startBlock: 14645816,
    },
  },
});
```

The indexing functions you register for a contract (or account) that uses `factory()` will process events for _all_ contracts (or accounts) found by the factory configuration.

## Index the factory contract itself

It's often useful to register an indexing function for the factory event itself, e.g. to run setup logic for each child contract.

To index the factory contract itself, add a new entry to `contracts`. This entry should be a normal contract with a single address.

```ts [ponder.config.ts]
import { createConfig, factory } from "ponder";
import { parseAbiItem } from "viem";
import { SudoswapPoolAbi } from "./abis/SudoswapPool";
import { SudoswapFactoryAbi } from "./abis/SudoswapFactory";

export default createConfig({
  networks: { /* ... */ },
  contracts: {
    SudoswapFactory: { // [!code focus]
      abi: SudoswapFactoryAbi, // [!code focus]
      network: "mainnet", // [!code focus]
      address: "0xb16c1342E617A5B6E4b631EB114483FDB289c0A4", // [!code focus]
      startBlock: 14645816, // [!code focus]
    }, // [!code focus]
    SudoswapPool: {
      abi: SudoswapPoolAbi,
      network: "mainnet",
      address: factory({
        address: "0xb16c1342E617A5B6E4b631EB114483FDB289c0A4",
        event: parseAbiItem("event NewPair(address poolAddress)"),
        parameter: "poolAddress",
      }),
      startBlock: 14645816,
    },
  },
});
```

```ts [src/index.ts]
import { ponder } from "ponder:registry";

// This function will run whenever a new child contract is created. // [!code focus]
ponder.on("SudoswapFactory:NewPair", async ({ event }) => { // [!code focus]
  // Address of the child contract that was created. // [!code focus]
  event.args.poolAddress; // [!code focus]
  //        ^? string // [!code focus]
}); // [!code focus]

ponder.on("SudoswapPool:Transfer", async ({ event }) => {
  // Address of the child contract that emitted the event.
  event.log.address;
  //        ^? string
});
```

## Multiple factories, same child

Sometimes, multiple factory contracts 1) have the same factory event signature and 2) create the same kind of child contract.

In these cases, you can pass a list of factory contract addresses to the `factory()` function, and the list of child addresses across all factories will be merged into a single list.

```ts [ponder.config.ts]
import { createConfig } from "ponder";
import { parseAbiItem } from "viem";
import { SudoswapPoolAbi } from "./abis/SudoswapPool";

export default createConfig({
  networks: { /* ... */ },
  contracts: {
    SudoswapPool: {
      abi: SudoswapPoolAbi,
      network: "mainnet",
      address: factory({
        // A list of factory contract addresses that all create SudoswapPool contracts. // [!code focus]
        address: [ // [!code focus]
          "0xb16c1342E617A5B6E4b631EB114483FDB289c0A4", // [!code focus]
          "0xb16c1342E617A5B6E4b631EB114483FDB289c0A4", // [!code focus]
        ], // [!code focus]
        event: parseAbiItem("event NewPair(address poolAddress)"),
        parameter: "poolAddress",
      }),
    },
  },
});
```

## Usage with non-factory contracts



The factory pattern is simply a primitive that extracts a list of addresses from event logs. The contract does not have to be a "factory" in the EVM/Solidity sense (it doesn't need to create other contracts).

For example, the `ENSRegistry` contract emits the `NewResolver` event whenever a name's resolver gets set or changed. We can use this event with the factory pattern to index all resolvers that have ever been used.

```ts [ponder.config.ts]
import { createConfig, factory } from "ponder";
import { parseAbiItem } from "viem";
import { ENSResolverAbi } from "./abis/ENSResolver";

export default createConfig({
  networks: { /* ... */ },
  contracts: {
    ENSResolver: {
      abi: ENSResolverAbi,
      network: "mainnet",
      address: factory({
        // ENS Registry address
        address: "0x00000000000C2E074eC69A0dFb2997BA6C7d2e1e",
        event: parseAbiItem("event NewResolver(bytes32 indexed node, address resolver)"),
        parameter: "resolver",
      }),
    },
  },
});
```

## How it works
  
1. Fetch logs emitted by the factory contract that match the configuration using `eth_getLogs` in bulk.
2. Decode each log using the provided `event` ABI item and extract the child address from it using the `parameter` name.
3. Fetch the requested data for each child contract – usually, more logs using `eth_getLogs` in bulk.

## Performance

As of version `0.10`, the factory pattern introduces negligible overhead to the indexing process.

## Limitations

### Event signature requirements

The factory contract must emit an event log announcing the creation of each new child contract that contains the new child contract address as a named parameter (with type `"address"`). The parameter can be either indexed or non-indexed. Here are a few factory event signatures with their eligibility explained:

```solidity
// ✅ Eligible. The parameter "child" has type "address" and is non-indexed.
event ChildContractCreated(address child);

// ✅ Eligible. The parameter "pool" has type "address" and is indexed.
event PoolCreated(address indexed deployer, address indexed pool, uint256 fee);

// ❌ Not eligible. The parameter "contracts" is an array type, which is not supported.
// Always emit a separate event for each child contract, even if they are created in a batch.
event ContractsCreated(address[] contracts);

// ❌ Not eligible. The parameter "child" is a struct/tuple, which is not supported.
struct ChildContract {
  address addr;
}
event ChildCreated(ChildContract child);
```

### Nested factory patterns

Ponder does not support factory patterns that are nested beyond a single layer.
