# Get started [An introduction to Ponder]

## What is Ponder?

Ponder is an open-source framework for custom Ethereum indexing.

You write TypeScript code to transform onchain data into your application's schema. Then, Ponder fetches data from the chain, runs your indexing logic, and writes the result to Postgres.

Once indexed, you can query the data through GraphQL, SQL over HTTP, or directly in Postgres.

## Quickstart

::::steps

### Run `create-ponder`

The quickest way to create a new Ponder project is `create-ponder`, which sets up everything automatically for you.

:::code-group

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm create ponder
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn create ponder
```

```bash [npm]
npm init ponder@latest
```

:::

On installation, you'll see a few prompts.

:::code-group

```ansi [Default]
✔ What's the name of your project? › new-project
✔ Which template would you like to use? › Default

✔ Installed packages with pnpm.
✔ Initialized git repository.
```

```ansi [Etherscan template]
✔ What's the name of your project? › new-project
✔ Which template would you like to use? › Etherscan contract link
✔ Enter a block explorer contract url › https://basescan.org/address/0x3bf93770f2d4a794c3d9ebefbaebae2a8f09a5e5

✔ Fetched contract metadata from basescan.org.
✔ Installed packages with pnpm.
✔ Initialized git repository.
```

### Start the dev server

Start the local development server.

:::code-group

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm dev
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn dev
```

```bash [npm]
npm run dev
```

:::

:::tip
By default, Ponder fetches data from public RPC endpoints and writes to PGlite, an embedded Postgres database. You can change these settings later.

### Query the database

Next, visit [localhost:42069/graphql](http://localhost:42069/graphql) in your browser to explore the auto-generated GraphQL API. Here's a query for the top accounts by balance, along with the total number of accounts.

:::code-group

```graphql [Query]
query {
  accounts(orderBy: "balance", orderDirection: "desc", limit: 2) {
    items {
      address
      balance
    }
    totalCount
  }
}
```

```json [Result]
{
  "accounts": {
    "items": [
      { "address": "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890", "balance": "1000000000000000000" },
      { "address": "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567891", "balance": "900000000000000000" },
    ],
    "totalCount": 1726,
  }
}
```

### Customize the schema

### Customize indexing logic

That's it! Next, learn about how to run Ponder in production, the factory pattern,
