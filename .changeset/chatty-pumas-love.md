(BREAKING) Removed `p.bytes()` in favor of a new `p.hex()` primitive column type. `p.hex()` is suitable for Ethereum addresses and other hex-encoded data, including EVM `bytes` types. `p.hex()` values are stored as `bytea` (Postgres) or `blob` (SQLite). To migrate, replace each occurence of `p.bytes()` in `ponder.schema.ts` with `p.hex()`, and ensure that any values you pass into hex columns are valid hexadecimal strings. The GraphQL API returns `p.hex()` values as hexadecimal strings, and allows sorting/filtering on `p.hex()` columns using the numeric comparison operators (`gt`, `gte`, `le`, `lte`).
