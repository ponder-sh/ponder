"@ponder/core": patch
---

Added support for `ponder serve` a new CLI command that runs the GraphQL API server as a standalone process. This is useful for horizontally scaling the API layer of a Ponder app. See the [horizontal scaling](https://ponder.sh/docs/production/horizontal-scaling) docs for more information.
