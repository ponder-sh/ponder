# Ponder with NextJs

## Getting Started

Both the frontend and backend can be run with:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

This example uses `graphql-codegen` to get typesafe graphql responses, the output of the codegen is in the `frontend/src/graphql/generated` directory.
