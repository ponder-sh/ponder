# Indexing function API

Indexing functions are user-defined functions that process blockchain data. They can be registered within any `.ts` file inside the `src/` directory. There are two kinds of events: **log events** and the **`"setup"` event**.

## Log events

Log events correspond to a smart contract event log that has occurred. The Ponder engine fetches event logs for all contracts defined in `ponder.config.ts`, then passes that data to the corresponding indexing function.

```ts filename="src/index.ts"
import { ponder } from "@/generated";

ponder.on("ContractName:EventName", async ({ event, context }) => {
  const { params, log, block, transaction } = event;
  const { models, contracts } = context;

  // ...
});
```

| [`event`](/api-reference/indexing-functions#event)     | Event-specific data (log arguments, log, block, and transaction) |
| [`context`](/api-reference/indexing-functions#context) | Global resources (model objects, read-only contract objects)     |

<Callout type="info">Value returned by indexing functions are ignored.</Callout>

### `Event`

The `event` object contains the log arguments, the transaction that produced the log, and the block containing that transaction. `Log`, `Block`, and `Transaction` are similar to the corresponding types from [viem](https://viem.sh), but are adapted to represent only the finalized blockchain state.

```ts
type Event = {
  name: string;
  params: {
    /* Event-specific ABI parameters typed using AbiParameterToPrimitiveType */
  };
  log: Log;
  block: Block;
  transaction: Transaction;
};
```

#### `Log`

The raw log object.

```ts
type Log = {
  /** Globally unique identifier for this log (`${blockHash}-${logIndex}`). */
  id: string;
  /** The address from which this log originated */
  address: Address;
  /** Hash of block containing this log */
  blockHash: Hash;
  /** Number of block containing this log */
  blockNumber: bigint;
  /** Contains the non-indexed arguments of the log */
  data: Hex;
  /** Index of this log within its block */
  logIndex: number;
  /** `true` if this log has been removed in a chain reorganization */
  removed: boolean;
  /** List of order-dependent topics */
  topics: [Hex, ...Hex[]] | [];
  /** Hash of the transaction that created this log */
  transactionHash: Hash;
  /** Index of the transaction that created this log */
  transactionIndex: number;
};
```

#### `Block`

The block containing the transaction that emitted this log.

```ts
type Block = {
  /** Base fee per gas */
  baseFeePerGas: bigint | null;
  /** "Extra data" field of this block */
  extraData: Hex;
  /** Maximum gas allowed in this block */
  gasLimit: bigint;
  /** Total used gas by all transactions in this block */
  gasUsed: bigint;
  /** Block hash */
  hash: Hash;
  /** Logs bloom filter */
  logsBloom: Hex;
  /** Address that received this block’s mining rewards */
  miner: Address;
  /** Block number */
  number: bigint;
  /** Parent block hash */
  parentHash: Hash;
  /** Root of the this block’s receipts trie */
  receiptsRoot: Hex;
  /** Size of this block in bytes */
  size: bigint;
  /** Root of this block’s final state trie */
  stateRoot: Hash;
  /** Unix timestamp of when this block was collated */
  timestamp: bigint;
  /** Total difficulty of the chain until this block */
  totalDifficulty: bigint | null;
  /** Root of this block’s transaction trie */
  transactionsRoot: Hash;
};
```

#### `Transaction`

The transaction that emitted this log.

```ts
type Transaction = {
  /** Hash of block containing this transaction */
  blockHash: Hash;
  /** Number of block containing this transaction */
  blockNumber: bigint;
  /** Chain ID. */
  chainId: number;
  /** Transaction sender */
  from: Address;
  /** Gas provided for transaction execution */
  gas: bigint;
  /** Base fee per gas. */
  gasPrice?: bigint | undefined;
  /** Hash of this transaction */
  hash: Hash;
  /** Contract code or a hashed method call */
  input: Hex;
  /** Total fee per gas in wei (gasPrice/baseFeePerGas + maxPriorityFeePerGas). */
  maxFeePerGas?: bigint | undefined;
  /** Max priority fee per gas (in wei). */
  maxPriorityFeePerGas?: bigint | undefined;
  /** Unique number identifying this transaction */
  nonce: number;
  /** Transaction recipient or `null` if deploying a contract */
  to: Address | null;
  /** Index of this transaction in the block */
  transactionIndex: number;
  /** Value in wei sent with this transaction */
  value: bigint;
};
```

### `Context`

This object contains CRUD objects for the tables defined in `ponder.schema.ts`, and a read-only contract object for each contract specified in `ponder.config.ts`.

```ts
type Context = {
  // Keyed by table names from ponder.schema.ts
  models: Record<string, Model>;
  // Keyed by contract names from ponder.config.ts
  contracts: Record<string, ReadOnlyContract>;
};
```

#### `Model`

These objects are used to create, read, update, and delete database records. `context.models` contains a `Model` object for each table defined in `schema.ponder.ts`.

See [Create & update records](/guides/create-update-records) for a complete API reference.

#### `ReadOnlyContract`

<Callout type="info">
  See the [read contract data](/guides/read-contract-data) guide for more
  details.
</Callout>

`ReadOnlyContract` objects are used to read data directly from a contract. These objects have a method for each read-only function present in the contract's ABI (functions with state mutability of `"pure"` or `"view"`). The `context.contracts` object has a `ReadOnlyContract` for each contract defined in [ponder.config.ts](/api-reference/ponder-config#contracts).

A `ReadOnlyContract` is a [viem Contract Instance](https://viem.sh/docs/contract/getContract.html#contract-instances) that has been modified to cache contract read results. By default, contract reads use the `eth_call` RPC method with `blockNumber` set to the block number of the event being processed (`event.block.number`). You can read the contract at a different block number (e.g. the contract deployment block number or `"latest"`) by passing the `blockNumber` or `blockTag` option, but this will disable caching.

```ts filename="src/index.ts"
import { ponder } from "@/generated";

ponder.on("MyERC20:Transfer", async ({ event, context }) => {
  const { MyERC20 } = context.contracts;

  // This read will occur at the block number of the event being
  // processed (event.block.number) and will be served from the cache
  // on hot reloads / reployments.
  const totalSupply = await MyERC20.read.totalSupply();

  // This read will occur at the latest block number when this function
  // runs, and will not be cached. Avoid this pattern.
  const currentBalance = await MyERC20.read.balanceOf("0xFa3...", {
    blockTag: "latest",
  });
});
```

## The `"setup"` event

You can also define an indexing function for a special event called `"setup"` that runs before all other events.

```ts filename="src/index.ts"
import { ponder } from "@/generated";

ponder.on("setup", async ({ context }) => {
  const { models, contracts } = context;

  // ...
});
```
