# Event handler `context`

Event handler functions receive two arguments: `event` and `context`.

The `context` object exposes the entities defined in `schema.graphql` and the contracts defined in `ponder.config.ts`.

```ts
type Context = {
  // Keyed by entity type names from schema.graphql
  entities: Record<string, Model>;
  // Keyed by contract names from ponder.config.ts
  contracts: Record<string, ReadOnlyContract>;
};
```

## Entities

`context.entities` an object-relational mapper for each entity in your `schema.graphql`. You can use these objects to insert and update entities that will be served automatically by the GraphQL server.

See [Create & update entities](/guides/create-update-entities) for a complete API reference.

## Contracts

`context.contracts` contains a `ReadOnlyContract` object for each contract in your `ponder.config.ts`. You can use these to read data directly from the smart contract using RPC calls.

<Callout type="warning">
  Reading directly from contracts is slow and expensive. If you're designing
  smart contracts that will be indexed by Ponder, try to emit events that
  include all the data you need.
