# Event handler `context`

Event handler functions receive two arguments: `event` and `context`.

The `context` object exposes the entities defined in `schema.graphql` and the contracts defined in `ponder.config.ts`.

```ts
interface Context {
  // Keyed by entity type names from schema.graphql
  entities: Record<string, EntityModel>;
  // Keyed by contract names from ponder.config.ts
  contracts: Record<string, ethers.Contract>;
}
```

## Entities

`context.entities` an object-relational mapper for each entity in your `schema.graphql`. You can use these objects to insert and update entities that will be served automatically by the GraphQL server.

```ts
interface EntityModel {
  get: (id: string) => Promise<Entity | null>;
  insert: (id: string, obj: Omit<Entity, "id">) => Promise<Entity>;
  update: (id: string, obj: Partial<Omit<Entity, "id">>) => Promise<Entity>;
  delete: (id: string) => Promise<boolean>;
  upsert: (id: string, obj: Omit<Entity, "id">) => Promise<Entity>;
}
```

## Contracts

`context.contracts` contains an `ethers.Contract` object for each contract in your `ponder.config.ts`. You can use these to read data directly from the smart contract using RPC calls.

<Callout type="warning">
  Reading directly from contracts is slow and expensive. If you're designing
  smart contracts that will be indexed by Ponder, try to emit events
  including all the data you need. If you absolutely must read from a contract,
  you can dramatically speed up indexing by hard-coding a block number (e.g. the
  contract deployment block number) which allows Ponder to cache the results.
  You can do this by including a final argument to your contract call like
  this: `Contract.myFunction(...args, { blockTag: 12345 })`
