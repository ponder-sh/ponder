# Event handler `event`

Event handler functions receive two arguments: `event` and `context`.

The `event` object contains the event params, the transaction that produced the event, and the block containing that transaction. These types very closely match the corresponding types from `viem`.

## `Event`

The event being processed. This is the object passed as the first argument to every event handler function.

```ts
type ExampleEvent = {
  name: string;
  params: {
    /* ExampleEvent-specific parameters */
  };
  log: Log;
  block: Block;
  transaction: Transaction;
};
```

## `Log`

The log associated with this event.

```ts
type Log = {
  /** Globally unique identifier for this log */
  logId: `${Hash}-${number}`;
  /** Value used internally by Ponder to sort logs across networks */
  logSortKey: bigint;
  /** Unix timestamp of when the block containing this log was collated */
  blockTimestamp: bigint;

  /** The address from which this log originated */
  address: Address;
  /** Hash of block containing this log */
  blockHash: Hash;
  /** Number of block containing this log */
  blockNumber: bigint;
  /** Contains the non-indexed arguments of the log */
  data: Hex;
  /** Index of this log within its block */
  logIndex: number;
  /** Hash of the transaction that created this log */
  transactionHash: Hash;
  /** Index of the transaction that created this log */
  transactionIndex: number;
  /** List of order-dependent topics */
  topics: string[];
  /** `true` if this filter has been destroyed and is invalid */
  removed: boolean;
};
```

## `Block`

The block containing the transaction that emitted this event.

```ts
type Block = {
  /** Base fee per gas */
  baseFeePerGas: bigint | null;
  /** "Extra data" field of this block */
  extraData: Hex;
  /** Maximum gas allowed in this block */
  gasLimit: bigint;
  /** Total used gas by all transactions in this block */
  gasUsed: bigint;
  /** Block hash */
  hash: Hash | null;
  /** Logs bloom filter */
  logsBloom: Hex | null;
  /** Address that received this block’s mining rewards */
  miner: Address;
  /** Block number */
  number: bigint | null;
  /** Parent block hash */
  parentHash: Hash;
  /** Root of the this block’s receipts trie */
  receiptsRoot: Hex;
  /** Size of this block in bytes */
  size: bigint;
  /** Root of this block’s final state trie */
  stateRoot: Hash;
  /** Unix timestamp of when this block was collated */
  timestamp: bigint;
  /** Total difficulty of the chain until this block */
  totalDifficulty: bigint | null;
  /** Root of this block’s transaction trie */
  transactionsRoot: Hash;
};
```

## `Transaction`

The transaction that emitted this event.

```ts
type Transaction = {
  /** Hash of block containing this transaction */
  blockHash: Hash;
  /** Number of block containing this transaction */
  blockNumber: bigint;
  /** Chain ID. */
  chainId: number;
  /** Transaction sender */
  from: Address;
  /** Gas provided for transaction execution */
  gas: bigint;
  /** Base fee per gas. */
  gasPrice?: bigint | undefined;
  /** Hash of this transaction */
  hash: Hash;
  /** Contract code or a hashed method call */
  input: Hex;
  /** Total fee per gas in wei (gasPrice/baseFeePerGas + maxPriorityFeePerGas). */
  maxFeePerGas?: bigint | undefined;
  /** Max priority fee per gas (in wei). */
  maxPriorityFeePerGas?: bigint | undefined;
  /** Unique number identifying this transaction */
  nonce: number;
  /** Transaction recipient or `null` if deploying a contract */
  to: Address | null;
  /** Index of this transaction in the block */
  transactionIndex: number;
  /** Value in wei sent with this transaction */
  value: bigint;
};
```
