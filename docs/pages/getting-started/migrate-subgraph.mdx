# Migrate a Graph Protocol subgraph

<Steps>

### Create a Ponder project

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs items={["pnpm", "yarn", "npm"]}>
  <Tab>
```
pnpm create ponder
```
</Tab>
  <Tab>
```
yarn create ponder
```
</Tab>
  <Tab>
```
npm create ponder@latest
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

First, enter a project name. Then select the **Subgraph ID** template option and paste in your subgraph's deployment ID:

<div className="caption">
  [MakerDAO's
  subgraph](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/protofire/makerdao-governance)
  on the Graph Protocol's hosted service.
</div>

The newly generated Ponder app will copy the subgraph's `schema.graphql` as well as the addresses, ABIs, and start blocks for each event source defined in `subgraph.yaml`. Then, it will create a project directory, install dependencies, and initialize a git repository.

<Callout type="warning">
  Ponder requires `node-gyp` to be installed globally. If you encounter an
  installation error, try `pnpm install -g node-gyp` and then run
  `create-ponder` again.
</Callout>

### Start the development server

Just like Next.js and Vite, Ponder has a development server that automatically reloads when you save changes in any project file. It also prints `console.log` statements and errors encountered while running your code.

First, `cd` into your project directory, then start the server.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs items={["pnpm", "yarn", "npm"]}>
  <Tab>
```
pnpm dev
```
</Tab>
  <Tab>
```
yarn dev
```
</Tab>
  <Tab>
```
npm run dev
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Add an RPC URL

Ponder fetches data using the standard Ethereum RPC API. To get started, you'll need an RPC URL from a provider like Alchemy or Infura.

Open up `.env.local` and paste in RPC URLs for any networks that your project uses:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js filename=".env.local"
PONDER_RPC_URL_1 = "https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/..."
```

### Write event handler functions

Open an event handler file in the `src/` directory. Ponder event handler functions are very similar to subgraph mapping functions, with some key differences. You will need to refactor your code, but because the local dev server has hot reloading, you'll get instant feedback on your changes.

See [tips for migrating mapping functions](/getting-started/migrate-subgraph#tips-for-migrating-mapping-functions) for more details.

### Query the GraphQL API

As you migrate your event handlers and start inserting entity data, open the GraphiQL interface at `http://localhost:42069/graphql` to explore your GraphQL API locally. Any changes you make to your `schema.graphql` file will be reflected here.

</Steps>

## Tips for migrating mapping functions

### Handlers run in Node.js, not WebAssembly

You can import NPM packages, debug with `console.log`, and use normal JavaScript types like `string` and `number`.

### Entities & contracts are injected, not imported

In a Graph Protocol subgraph mapping file, entity models and contract factories are imported:

```ts filename="mapping.ts (Graph Protocol)"
import { Token, Wallet } from "../generated/schema";
import { MyNftContract } from "../generated/MyNftContract/MyNftContract";

export function handleTransfer(event) {
  // Get an entity object
  const token = Token.load(event.params.id);

  // Bind and call a contract
  const tokenUri = MyNftContract.bind("0x137...01a2").tokenUri(token.id);

  // ...
}
```

With Ponder, entity models and contracts are injected as properties of `context`.

The `contract.contracts` objects are [viem Contract Instances](https://viem.sh/docs/contract/getContract.html) that are already connected to the network specified in `ponder.config.ts`. (You don't need to call `Contract.bind(address)`.

```ts filename="src/MyNftContract.ts"
import { ponder } from "@/generated";

ponder.on("MyNftContract:Transfer", async ({ event, context }) => {
  const { Token } = context.entities;
  const { MyNftContract } = context.contracts;

  // Get an entity object
  const token = await Token.findUnique({ id: event.params.id });

  // Call a contract read function
  const tokenUri = await MyNftContract.read.tokenUri(token.id);

  // ...
});
```
