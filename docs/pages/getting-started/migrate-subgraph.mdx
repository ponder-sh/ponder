# Migrate a Graph Protocol subgraph

The `create-ponder` CLI tool makes it easy to migrate a subgraph to Ponder.

<div className="steps-container">

### Run the `create-ponder` CLI tool

This command creates a project folder called `ponder` in the current working directory. Include the `--from-subgraph` option with a path to a Graph Protocol subgraph repo on your local machine.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs items={["pnpm", "yarn", "npm"]}>
  <Tab>
```bash
pnpm create ponder --from-subgraph ...
```
</Tab>
  <Tab>
```bash
yarn create ponder --from-subgraph ...
```
</Tab>
  <Tab>
```bash
npm create ponder@latest -- --from-subgraph ...
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Start the development server

The dev server is an important part of the Ponder development workflow. Just like Next.js, the dev server automatically reloads when you save changes in any project file. It also prints `console.log` statements and errors encountered while running your code.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs items={["pnpm", "yarn", "npm"]}>
  <Tab>
```bash
cd ponder
pnpm dev
```
</Tab>
  <Tab>
```bash
cd ponder
yarn dev
```
</Tab>
  <Tab>
```bash
cd ponder
npm run dev
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Add an RPC URL

Ponder fetches data using the Ethereum RPC API. To get started, you'll need an RPC URL from a provider like Alchemy or Infura.

Open up `.env.local` and paste in your RPC URL:

```bash filename=".env.local"
PONDER_RPC_URL_1 = https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/...
```

### Write event handler functions

Open an event handler file in the `handlers/` directory. Ponder event handler functions are very similar to subgraph mapping functions, with some key differences. You will need to refactor your code, but because the local dev server has hot reloading, you'll get instant feedback on your changes.

See [tips for migrating mapping functions](/getting-started/migrate-subgraph#tips-for-migrating-mapping-functions) for more details.

### Query the GraphQL API

As you migrate your event handlers and start inserting entity data, open the GraphiQL interface at `http://localhost:42069/graphl` to explore your GraphQL API locally. Any changes you make to your `schema.graphql` file will be reflected here.

## Tips for migrating mapping functions

### Handlers run in Node.js, not WebAssembly

You can import NPM packages, debug with `console.log`, and use normal JavaScript types like `string` and `number`.

### Entities & contracts are injected, not imported

In a Graph Protocol subgraph mapping file, entity models and contract factories are imported:

```ts filename="mapping.ts (Graph Protocol)"
import { Token, Wallet } from "../generated/schema";
import { SomeNftContract } from "../generated/SomeNftContract/SomeNftContract";

export function handleTransfer(event) {
  // Get an entity object
  const token = Token.load(event.params.id);

  // Bind and call a contract
  const tokenUri = SomeNftContract.bind("0x137...01a2").tokenUri(token.id);

  // ...
}
```

With Ponder, entity models and contracts are injected as properties of `context`.

Contracts injected this way are ready-to-go using the address and network specified in `ponder.ts`. (You don't need to call `Contract.bind(address)`. The contracts are normal `ethers.Contract` objects that are already connected to a provider.

```ts filename="SomeNftContract.ts"
export async function handleTransfer(event, context) {
  const { Token } = context.entities;
  const { SomeNftContract } = context.contracts;

  // Get an entity object
  const token = await Token.get(event.params.id);

  // Call a contract read function
  const tokenUri = await SomeNftContract.tokenUri(token.id);

  // ...
}
```
