# Logging

Ponder produces logs to help you understand and debug your application. To change the log level, set the `PONDER_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to one of the following values. Note that each level includes logs from all levels above it.

| Log level        | Sample                                            |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| `silent`         | N/A                                               |
| `error`          | Unrecoverable RPC error, SQL constraint violation |
| `warn`           | Reorg reconciliation, malformed config            |
| `info` (default) | Indexing progress, real-time block processing     |
| `debug`          | Internal service lifecycle events                 |
| `trace`          | Query-level database logs                         |

<Callout type="info">
  Logs produced by your handler code (e.g. `console.log` statements) will always
  be written to the console. Note that Ponder _does_ catch **errors** throw by
  your handler code, and will emit an `error` log including the error message
  and stack trace.
</Callout>

## Console output

Ponder writes pretty-printed logs to the console. During development, there is an auto-updating TUI built with [Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink).

## Log files

Ponder also writes `trace`-level logs as structured JSON to a file at `.ponder/logs/{timestamp}.log`. Each file contains all the logs produced during a single run of the Ponder process (`ponder dev` or `ponder start`), named using the start timestamp.
