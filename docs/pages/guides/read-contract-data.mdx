# Read contract data

Ideally, smart contracts emit event logs containing all the data you need to build your application. In practice, developers often forget to include certain event logs, or omit them as a gas optimization. In some cases, you can address these gaps by reading data directly from a contract.

Here's a basic example of reading data from the same contract that emitted the event.

In this example, suppose the creator of an NFT contract forgot to include certain traits of an NFT in the `Mint` event data.

```ts
ponder.on...
```

## Supported actions

The `context.client` viem Client offers the following actions, all of which support caching.

When you use these actions from within indexing function code, the `blockNumber` option is automatically set to the block number of the event being processed (`event.block.number`). It's not currently possible to override this behavior.

| :----------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| readContract | Calls a read-only function on a contract.                 | [readContract](https://viem.sh/docs/contract/readContract.html)   |
| multicall    | Similar to readContract, but batches requests.            | [multicall](https://viem.sh/docs/contract/multicall.html)         |
| getBalance   | Returns the balance of an address in wei.                 | [getBalance](https://viem.sh/docs/actions/public/getBalance.html) |
| getBytecode  | Retrieves the bytecode at an address.                     | [getBytecode](https://viem.sh/docs/contract/getBytecode.html)     |
| getStorageAt | Returns the value from a storage slot at a given address. | [getStorageAt](https://viem.sh/docs/contract/getStorageAt.html)   |

## Read from a contract that's not indexed

To read from a contract that is not present in the `context.contracts` object

The `context.contracts` object only contains contracts that you have added in `ponder.config.ts`. Sometimes, it's useful for read from a contract without indexing it's event logs. To

The `context` object passed to every indexing function exposes a `client` property, which is a read-only viem Public Client that has been modified to cache all RPC method calls.

<Callout type="info">
  You should always use `context.client` rather than a manually constructed
  client. If you feel tempted to create your own client, please open a GitHub
  issue or send a message to the chat. We'd like to understand and accommodate
  your workflow.
</Callout>

The `context` object also has a `contracts` property, which is an object containing contract addresses and ABIs from `ponder.config.ts`.

The `context.contracts` object contains a read-only [viem contract instance](https://viem.sh/docs/contract/getContract.html#contract-instances) for each contract you define in [ponder.config.ts](/api-reference/ponder-config#contracts). These contract instances expose each read-only function (state mutability `"pure"` or `"view"`) present in the contract's ABI. They also [cache](#caching) contract read results, which speeds up indexing and avoids unnecessary RPC requests.

## Example

In this example, the `Blitmap:Mint` event does not include the token URI of the newly minted NFT. To add the token URI to the indexed data, we can read data directly from the contract using the `Blitmap.tokenURI` view method.

<div className="code-columns">

```ts filename="ponder.config.ts"
export const config = {
  /* ... */
  contracts: [
    {
      name: "Blitmap",
      network: "mainnet",
      abi: "./abis/Blitmap.json",
      address: "0x8d04...D3Ff63",
      startBlock: 12439123,
    },
  ],
};
```

```ts filename="src/index.ts"
ponder.on("Blitmap:Mint", async ({ event, context }) => {
  const { Blitmap } = context.contracts;

  const tokenUri = await Blitmap.read.tokenURI(event.params.tokenId);

  const token = await context.models.Token.create({
    id: event.params.tokenId,
    data: { uri: tokenUri },
  });
  // { id: 7777, uri: "https://api.blitmap.com/v1/metadata/7777" }
});
```

</div>

## Read contract data without syncing all events

When you add a contract in `ponder.config.ts`, Ponder fetches all event logs emitted by that contract. Sometimes, you _only_ want to read data from a contract (you don't need its event logs).

To tell Ponder not to fetch event logs for a contract, set `isLogEventSource: false` in your config.

<div className="code-columns">

```ts filename="ponder.config.ts"
export const config = {
  /* ... */
  contracts: [
    {
      name: "AaveToken",
      network: "mainnet",
      abi: "./abis/AaveToken.json",
      address: "0x7Fc6...2DDaE9",
      startBlock: 10926829,
    },
    {
      name: "AaveUsdPriceFeed",
      network: "mainnet",
      abi: "./abis/ChainlinkPriceFeed.json",
      address: "0x547a...19e8a9",
      isLogEventSource: false,
    },
  ],
};
```

```ts filename="src/index.ts"
ponder.on("AaveToken:Mint", async ({ event, context }) => {
  const { AaveUsdPriceFeed } = context.contracts;

  const priceData = await AaveUsdPriceFeed.read.latestRoundData();
  const usdValue = priceData.answer * event.params.amount;

  // ...
});
```

</div>

## Caching

To avoid unnecessary RPC requests and speed up indexing, Ponder caches all contract read results. When an indexing function that reads a contract runs for the first time, it will make an RPC request. But on subsequent hot reloads or redeployments, this data will be served from the cache.

To take advantage of caching, you _must_ use `context.contracts`. _Do not manually set up a viem Client._

<div className="code-columns">

```ts filename="src/index.ts"
// Don't do this! ❌ ❌ ❌

import { createPublicClient, getContract, http } from "viem";

const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  transport: http("https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/..."),
});

const Blitmap = getContract({
  address: "0x8d04...D3Ff63",
  abi: blitmapAbi,
  publicClient,
});

ponder.on("Blitmap:Mint", async ({ event, context }) => {
  const tokenUri = await Blitmap.read.tokenURI(event.params.tokenId);
  // ...
});
```

```ts filename="src/index.ts"
// Do this instead. ✅ ✅ ✅

ponder.on("Blitmap:Mint", async ({ event, context }) => {
  const { Blitmap } = context.contracts;

  const tokenUri = await Blitmap.read.tokenURI(event.params.tokenId);
  // ...
});
```

</div>

## Specify a block number

By default, contract reads use the `eth_call` RPC method with `blockNumber` set to the block number of the event being processed (`event.block.number`). You can read the contract at a different block number (e.g. the contract deployment block number or `"latest"`) by passing the `blockNumber` or `blockTag` option, but this will disable caching.

```ts filename="src/index.ts"
ponder.on("Blitmap:Mint", async ({ event, context }) => {
  const { Blitmap } = context.contracts;

  const { tokenId } = event.params;

  // Read at event.block.number, caching enabled ✅
  const latestTokenUri = await Blitmap.read.tokenURI(tokenId);

  // Read at 17226745, caching disabled ❌
  const historicalTokenUri = await Blitmap.read.tokenURI(tokenId, {
    blockNumber: 17226745,
  });

  // Read at "latest", caching disabled ❌
  const latestTokenUri = await Blitmap.read.tokenURI(tokenId, {
    blockTag: "latest",
  });
});
```
