# Installation

## System requirements

- MacOS, Linux, or Windows (via [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)). Windows without WSL is not currently supported.
- [Node.js 18 or 20](https://nodejs.org/en)
- npm, [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) (recommended)

<Callout type="warning">
  If you encounter an installation error, try `npm install -g node-gyp` and then
  run `create-ponder` again. Ponder often requires `node-gyp` to be installed
  globally to build `better-sqlite3` from source
  ([#1043](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3/issues/1043)).
</Callout>

## Create Ponder

The [Create Ponder CLI tool](/getting-started/new-project) sets up everything automatically for you. If Create Ponder runs without error, your system meets the requirements and you should be good to go.
