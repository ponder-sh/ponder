# Installation

<Callout type="warning">
  Ponder usually requires `node-gyp` to be installed globally. If you encounter
  an installation error, try `npm install -g node-gyp` and then run
  `create-ponder` again.
</Callout>

## System requirements

- MacOS, Linux, or Windows (via [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install))
- [Node.js 18 or 20](https://nodejs.org/en)
- npm, [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) (recommended)

## Create Ponder

The [Create Ponder CLI tool](/getting-started/new-project) sets up everything automatically for you. If Create Ponder runs without error, your system meets the requirements and you should be good to go.
