# Developing with Foundry

Ponder makes it convenient to test indexing events when developing your dapp locally. Check out the [foundry example](https://github.com/ponder-sh/ponder/tree/main/examples/with-foundry) to see an example on how you can get started working with ponder and foundry.

Before you begin, make sure you have followed the [installation](../guides/installation.mdx) and [getting started](../guides/installation.mdx) guides.

## Creating an `anvil` network

In your `ponder.config.ts` file, add a new network with the name `anvil`. Use the same chain ID as your `anvil` node, and the `http` transport with the URL of your `anvil` node.

```ts filename="ponder.config.ts"
export const config: Config = {
  // ...
  networks: [
    // ...
    {
      name: "anvil",
      chainId: 31337,
      transport: http(process.env.PONDER_RPC_URL_8545),
    },
  ],
```

## Generating the ABI

Ponder uses the ABI to generate the typescript types for your contracts. To generate the ABI, we recommend using the [`wagmi` cli](https://wagmi.sh/cli/getting-started) tool with the foundry plugin. Follow the steps in the `wagmi` documentation to set up an ABI generation pipeline. You can see an example of this in the [foundry example](https://github.com/ponder-sh/ponder/tree/main/examples/with-foundry)

## Running `anvil`

After generating the ABI and adding the `anvil` network to your `ponder.config.ts` file, you can start your `anvil` node. Then, run `ponder dev` in a separate terminal window. Ponder will automatically detect the `anvil` network and will start listening for events and index them as expected.

### Restarting `anvil` and ponder

If you restart your `anvil` node, you will need to reload ponder's DB to ensure that the indexer is up to date. To make this convenient for you during new deployments to `anvil`, we provided a route available only during development. You can use this URL to reload your DB and start indexing from scratch. To use this URL, run the following command:

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:42069/admin/reload?chainId=31337
```

<Callout type="info">
  This assumes you are using the default port of 42069 for ponder and the
  canonical chain ID for anvil. If you are using a different port or chain ID,
  change up the variables accordingly.
</Callout>
