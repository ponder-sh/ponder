# Logging

Ponder produces logs to help you understand and debug your application. To change the log level, set the `PONDER_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable. Each level includes logs from all levels above it.

```js filename=".env.local"
PONDER_LOG_LEVEL = "debug"
```

| Log level        | Example                                           |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| `silent`         |                                                   |
| `error`          | Unrecoverable RPC error, SQL constraint violation |
| `warn`           | Reorg reconciliation, malformed config            |
| `info` (default) | Indexing progress, real-time block processing     |
| `debug`          | Internal service lifecycle events                 |
| `trace`          | Query-level database logs                         |

Logs produced by your code in `src/` (e.g. `console.log` statements) will always be written to the console. Note that Ponder _does_ catch **errors** thrown by your code and emits an `error` log including the error message and stack trace.

## Console output

Ponder writes pretty-printed logs to the console. During development, there is an auto-updating TUI built with [Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink).

## Log files

Ponder also writes `trace`-level logs as structured JSON to a file at `.ponder/logs/{timestamp}.log`. Each file contains all the logs produced during a single run of the Ponder process (`ponder dev` or `ponder start`), named using the process start timestamp.
