# Deploy

## Railway (recommended)

[Railway](https://railway.app) is currently the best place to deploy Ponder apps. Most Ponder apps cost ~$5 per month, and the deployment process is simple.

<Steps>

### Sign up or log in to Railway

Connect your GitHub account, and make sure that your Ponder app has been pushed to remote.

### Create a Ponder app service

From the Railway console:

1. Click **New Project** → **Deploy from GitHub repo** and select your repo from the list
2. Click **Add variables**, then add your project's RPC URL (e.g. `PONDER_RPC_URL_1`) and any other environment variables
3. Expose your service to the public internet. Open the **Settings** tab and click **Generate Domain** under **Networking**
4. Set a healthcheck path. In the **Settings** tab, enter `/health` for **Healthcheck Path** under **Deploy**

<Callout type="warning">
  _Monorepo users:_ Update the service **Root Directory** and/or **Start Command**
  to run `ponder start` at the Ponder project root. For example, set the root
  directory to `packages/ponder` or set the start command to `cd packages/ponder
  && pnpm start`.
</Callout>

### Create a Postgres database service

1. From your project's dashboard, click **New** → **Database** → **Add PostgreSQL**.
2. Go back to your service. Open **Variables** tab and click on **New Variable**
3. Click on **Add Reference**, select `DATABASE_PRIVATE_URL`, and click on **Add**

After a moment, your Ponder service should redeploy successfully. Check the **Build Logs** and **Deploy Logs** tabs to debug any issues.

</Steps>

## Other environments

Ponder has not been thoroughly tested on cloud providers other than Railway. However, Ponder apps should work in any environment that supports Node.js and can connect to a Postgres database.
