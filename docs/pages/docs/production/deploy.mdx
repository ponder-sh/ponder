# Deploy

You can deploy your Ponder app to any cloud environment that supports Node.js.

- [Railway](#railway)
- [Self-hosting](#self-hosting)

## Railway

[Railway](https://railway.app)'s general-purpose cloud platform is a great starting point for most Ponder apps.

<Steps>

### Log in to Railway

Connect your GitHub account, and make sure that your Ponder app has been pushed to remote.

### Create a Ponder app service

From the Railway console:

1. Click **New Project** → **Deploy from GitHub repo** and select your repo from the list
2. Click **Add variables**, then add RPC URLs (e.g. `PONDER_RPC_URL_1`) and other environment variables
3. Create a public domain. In **Settings** → **Networking**, click **Generate Domain**
4. Update the start command. In **Settings** → **Deploy**, set the **Custom Start Command** to include the `--schema` option. This is required to enable zero-downtime deployments. [Read more](/docs/getting-started/database#database-schema).

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs items={["pnpm", "yarn", "npm"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```text filename="Start command"
pnpm start --schema $RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_ID
```
</Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```text filename="Start command"
yarn start --schema $RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_ID
```
</Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```text filename="Start command"
npm run start -- --schema $RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_ID
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

5. Set the healthcheck path and timeout. In **Settings** → **Deploy**, set the **Healthcheck Path** to `/ready` and the **Healthcheck Timeout** to `86400` seconds (1 day)

<Callout type="info">
  _Monorepo users:_ Use the **Root Directory** and/or **Start Command** options
  to run `ponder start` at the Ponder project root, e.g. set the root directory
  to `packages/ponder` or set the start command to `cd packages/ponder && pnpm
  start`.
</Callout>

### Create a Postgres database

From the new project dashboard:

1. Click **Create** → **Database** → **Add PostgreSQL**
2. Open the **Variables** tab for the Ponder app service, click **New Variable** → **Add Reference** → select `DATABASE_URL` and click **Add**

</Steps>

After a moment, the service running `ponder start` should redeploy successfully. Check the **Build Logs** and **Deploy Logs** tabs to debug any issues.

## Self hosting

In general, hosting a Ponder app is similar to hosting a normal Node.js web server. This section describes the key Ponder-specific quirks to consider when self-hosting.

### Database connection

<Callout type="info">
  Your app will run into performance issues if the roundtrip database latency
  exceeds ~20 milliseconds. This is common when using a database in different
  private network or cloud region.
</Callout>

In production, Ponder works best with a Postgres database in the same private network. Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to the connection string of your Postgres database, or manually override the `database.connectionString` option in `ponder.config.ts`.

```ts filename="ponder.config.ts" {6}
import { createConfig } from "ponder";

export default createConfig({
  database: {
    kind: "postgres",
    connectionString: "postgres://user:password@mycloud.internal:5432/database",
  },
  // ... more config
});
```

### Database schema

Each deployment must use a different database schema. Use the `DATABASE_SCHEMA` environment variable or the `--schema` CLI argument passed to `ponder start` to specify which database schema each deployment should use. [Read more](/docs/api-reference/database#database-schema-rules) about database schema selection rules.

The best choice depends on your deployment strategy – here are a few common options.

- Kubernetes pod name
- Railway deployment ID
- Git branch name or commit hash

### Health checks & probes

Use the `/health` and `/ready` endpoints to configure health checks or [probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/liveness-readiness-startup-probes/).

- **`/health`**: Returns an HTTP `200` response immediately after the process starts.
- **`/ready`**: Returns an HTTP `200` response once indexing progress has reached realtime across all chains. During the historical backfill, the endpoint returns an HTTP `503` response.

### Crash recovery

If a Ponder app running `ponder start` crashes and restarts using the same database schema, it will attempt to resume indexing where it left off. [Read more](/docs/api-reference/database#build-id-and-crash-recovery) about the instance lifecycle and crash recovery mechanism.

## Advanced

### Scale the HTTP server

If a `ponder start` instance receives a large volume of HTTP traffic (e.g. GraphQL requests), the HTTP server will contend with the indexing engine for CPU and memory resources. This can lead to degraded indexing performance and might ultimately crash the instance.

To solve this problem, you can use `ponder serve` to run additional instances of the HTTP server without the indexing engine. Here are a few things to keep in mind.

- The `ponder serve` instance should use the same [database schema](#database-schema) as the `ponder start` instance that you'd like to scale.
- If one `ponder serve` instance is not enough, you can safely run multiple replicas behind a proxy using an architecture like this.

```

### Database maintenance

The `ponder db` CLI entrypoint offers a set of commands useful for observing and maintaining your database. [Read more](/docs/api-reference/ponder-cli#db).
