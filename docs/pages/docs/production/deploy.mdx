# Deploy

You can deploy your Ponder app to any cloud environment that supports Node.js.

- [Railway](#railway)
- [Self-hosting](#self-hosting)

## Railway

[Railway](https://railway.app)'s general-purpose cloud platform is a great starting point for most Ponder apps.

<Steps>

### Log in to Railway

Connect your GitHub account, and make sure that your Ponder app has been pushed to remote.

### Create a Ponder app service

From the Railway console:

1. Click **New Project** → **Deploy from GitHub repo** and select your repo from the list
2. Click **Add variables**, then add RPC URLs (e.g. `PONDER_RPC_URL_1`) and other environment variables
3. Create a public domain. In **Settings** → **Networking**, click **Generate Domain**
4. Set the healthcheck path and timeout. In **Settings** → **Deploy**, set the **Healthcheck Path** to `/ready` and the **Healthcheck Timeout** to `86400` seconds (1 day)

<Callout type="warning">
  _Monorepo users:_ Configure the **Root Directory** and **Start Command** such
  that `ponder start` runs at the Ponder project root. For example, set the root
  directory to `packages/ponder` or set the start command to `cd packages/ponder
  && pnpm start`.
</Callout>

### Create a Postgres database

From the new project dashboard:

1. Click **Create** → **Database** → **Add PostgreSQL**
2. Open the **Variables** tab for the Ponder app service, click **New Variable** → **Add Reference** → select `DATABASE_URL` and click **Add**

After a moment, the Ponder app service should redeploy successfully. Check the **Build Logs** and **Deploy Logs** tabs to debug any issues.

</Steps>

## Self hosting

In general, hosting a Ponder app is similar to hosting a normal Node.js HTTP server. Rather than offer a step-by-step guide, this section describes the key Ponder-specific quirks to consider when self-hosting.

### Health checks & probes

Use the `/health` and `/ready` endpoints to configure health checks or [probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/liveness-readiness-startup-probes/).

- **`/health`**: Returns an HTTP `200` response immediately after the process starts.
- **`/ready`**: Returns an HTTP `200` response once indexing progress has reached realtime across all chains. During the historical backfill, the endpoint returns an HTTP `503` response.

### Database connection

<Callout type="warning">
  Your app will have performance issues if the roundtrip database latency exceeds
  ~20 milliseconds. This is common when using a database in different private
  network or region.
</Callout>

In production, Ponder works best with a Postgres database in the same private network. Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to the connection string of your Postgres database, or manually override the `database.connectionString` option in `ponder.config.ts`.

```ts filename="ponder.config.ts" {6}
import { createConfig } from "@ponder/core";

export default createConfig({
  database: {
    kind: "postgres",
    connectionString: "postgres://user:password@mycloud.internal:5432/database",
  },
  // ... more config
});
```

### Table names and live views

When a Ponder app starts up, it creates a table in the database for each table exported from `ponder.schema.ts`. To avoid naming conflicts with prior instances of the same app, the tables are prefixed with a random four-character `instance_id`.

When the app finishes the historical backfill (or immediately after startup when using `ponder dev`) it creates a view for each table in `ponder.schema.ts` using this command.

```sql
CREATE VIEW {table_name} AS ( SELECT * FROM {instance_id}__{table_name} );
```

The **live view** mechanism is essential for zero-downtime deployments, horizontal scaling, and direct SQL queries.

#### Example

Here's a zero-downtime redeployment scenario, where views continously serve data from the most recent instance to go live.

1. App `1234` starts up. It creates and begins writing to a table named `1234__account`.
2. App `1234` completes the historical backfill. It creates a view named `account` that points at `1234__account`.
3. App `5678` starts up. It creates and begins writing to a table named `5678__account`.
4. App `5678` completes the historical backfill. It updates the `account` view to point at `5678__account`.
5. App `1234` shuts down.
6. App `5678` continues to serve live data via the `account` view.

### Crash recovery

If a Ponder app running `ponder start` crashes and restarts, it will attempt to resume indexing where it left off. [Read more](/docs/api-reference/database) about the instance lifecycle and crash recovery mechanism.
