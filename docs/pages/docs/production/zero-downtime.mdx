# Zero-downtime deployments ðŸš§

## Healthchecks

Ponder supports zero-downtime deployments by waiting until all events have been processed before responding as healthy. To support long-running backfills, Ponder apps will begin responding as healthy _before_ the backfill is complete if it exceeds the `maxHealthcheckDuration`. This option defaults 240 seconds (4 minutes), and is configurable using [`options.maxHealthcheckDuration`](/docs/api-reference/config#options).

If you're using Railway, Ponder will set `maxHealthcheckDuration` automatically according to the **Healthcheck Timeout** specified in your app service settings.
