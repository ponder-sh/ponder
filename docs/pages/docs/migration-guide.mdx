## 0.2.0

### Replaced `p.bytes()` with `p.hex()`

Removed `p.bytes()` in favor of a new `p.hex()` primitive column type. `p.hex()` is suitable for Ethereum addresses and other hex-encoded data, including EVM `bytes` types. `p.hex()` values are stored as `bytea` (Postgres) or `blob` (SQLite). To migrate, replace each occurence of `p.bytes()` in `ponder.schema.ts` with `p.hex()`, and ensure that any values you pass into hex columns are valid hexadecimal strings. The GraphQL API returns `p.hex()` values as hexadecimal strings, and allows sorting/filtering on `p.hex()` columns using the numeric comparison operators (`gt`, `gte`, `le`, `lte`).

### Cursor pagination

Updated the GraphQL API to use cursor pagination instead of offset pagination. Note that this change also affects the `findMany` database method. See the [GraphQL pagination docs](/docs/guides/query-the-graphql-api#pagination) for more details.

## 0.1.0

Config

- In general, `ponder.config.ts` now has much more static validation using TypeScript. This includes network names in `contracts`, ABI event names for the contract `event` and `factory` options, and more.
- The `networks` and `contracts` fields were changed from an array to an object. The network or contract name is now specified using an object property name. The `name` field for both networks and contracts was removed.
- The `filter` field has been removed. To index all events matching a specific signature across all contract addresses, add a contract that specifies the `event` field without specifying an `address`.
- The `abi` field now requires an ABI object that has been asserted as const (cannot use a file path). See the ABIType documentation for more details.

Schema

- The schema definition API was rebuilt from scratch to use a TypeScript file `ponder.schema.ts` instead of `schema.graphql`. The `ponder.schema.ts` file has static validation using TypeScript.
- Note that it is possible to convert a `schema.graphql` file into a `ponder.schema.ts` file without introducing any breaking changes to the autogenerated GraphQL API schema.
- Please see the `design your schema` guide for an overview of the new API.

Indexing functions

- `event.params` was renamed to `event.args` to better match Ethereum terminology norms.
- If a contract uses the `event` option, only the specified events will be available for registration. Before, all events in the ABI were available.
- `context.models` was renamed to `context.db`
- Now, a read-only Viem client is available at `context.client`. This client uses the same transport you specify in `ponder.config.ts`, except all method are cached to speed up subsequent indexing.
- The `context.contracts` object now contains the contract addresses and ABIs specified in`ponder.config.ts`, typed as strictly as possible. (You should not need to copy addresses and ABIs around anymore, just use `context.contracts`).
- A new `context.network` object was added which contains the network name and chain ID that the current event is from.

Multi-chain indexing

- The contract `network` field `ponder.config.ts` was upgraded to support an object of network-specific overrides. This is a much better DX for indexing the same contract on multiple chains.
- The options that you can specify per-network are `address`, `event`, `startBlock`, `endBlock`, and `factory`.
- When you add a contract on multiple networks, Ponder will sync the contract on each network you specify. Any indexing functions you register for the contract will now process events across all networks.
- The `context.network` object is typed according to the networks that the current contract runs on, so you can write network-specific logic like `if (context.network.name === ‚Äúoptimism‚Äù) { ‚Ä¶`

Vite

- Ponder now uses Vite to transform and load your code. This means you can import files from outside the project root directory.
- Vite‚Äôs module graph makes it possible to invalidate project files granularly, only reloading the specific parts of your app that need to be updated when a specific file changes. For example, if you save a change to one of your ABI files, `ponder.config.ts` will reload because it imports that file, but your schema will not reload.
- This update also unblocks a path towards concurrent indexing and granular caching of indexing function results.
