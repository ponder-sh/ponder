# Migration guide

## 0.6.0

### Updated `viem` to `>=2`

This release updates the `viem` peer dependency requirement to `>=2`. The `context.client` action `getBytecode` was renamed to `getCode`.

### Simplified Postgres schema pattern

Starting with this release, the indexed tables, reorg tables, and metadata table for a Ponder app are contained in one Postgres schema, specified by the user in `ponder.config.ts` (defaults to `public`). This means the shared `ponder` schema is no longer used. (Note: The `ponder_sync` schema is still in use).

This release also removes the view publishing pattern and the `publishSchema` option from `ponder.config.ts`, which may disrupt production setups using horizontal scaling or direct SQL. If you relied on the publish pattern, please [get in touch on Telegram](https://t.me/kevinkoste) and we'll work to get you unblocked.

### Added `/ready`, updated `/health`

The new `/ready` endpoint returns an HTTP `200` response once the app **is ready to serve requests**. This means that historical indexing is complete and the app is indexing events in realtime.

The existing `/health` endpoint now returns an HTTP `200` response as soon as the process starts. (This release removes the `maxHealthcheckDuration` option, which previously governed the behavior of `/health`.)

For Railway users, we now recommend using `/ready` as the health check endpoint to enable zero downtime deployments. If your app takes a while to sync, be sure to set the healthcheck timeout accordingly. Read the [Railway deployment guide](/docs/production/deploy#railway) for more details.

### Metrics updates

Please see the [changelog](https://github.com/ponder-sh/ponder/blob/main/packages/core/CHANGELOG.md#060) for specifics.

## 0.5.0

### `hono` peer dependency

**Breaking:** This release adds [Hono](https://hono.dev) as a peer dependency. After upgrading, install `hono` in your project.

### Introduced API functions

This release added support for API functions. [Read more](/docs/query/api-functions).

## 0.4.0

This release changes the location of database tables when using both SQLite and Postgres.

It **does not** require any changes to your application code, and does not bust the sync cache for SQLite or Postgres.

Please read the new docs on [direct SQL](/docs/query/direct-sql) for a detailed overview.

### SQLite

Ponder now uses the `.ponder/sqlite/public.db` file for indexed tables. Before, the tables were present as views in the `.ponder/sqlite/ponder.db`. Now, the`.ponder/sqlite/ponder.db` file is only used internally by Ponder.

### Postgres

Ponder now creates a table in the `public` schema for each table in `ponder.schema.ts`. Before, Ponder created them as views in the `ponder` schema.

Isolation while running multiple Ponder instances against the same database also works differently. Before, Ponder used a schema with a pseudorandom name if the desired schema was in use. Now, Ponder will fail on startup with an error if it cannot acquire a lock on the desired schema.

This also changes the zero-downtime behavior on platforms like Railway. For more information on how this works in `0.4`, please reference:
- [Direct SQL](/docs/query/direct-sql)
- [Zero-downtime deployments](/docs/production/zero-downtime)

### Postgres table cleanup

After upgrading to `0.4.x`, you can run the following Postgres SQL script to clean up stale tables and views created by `0.3.x` Ponder apps.

**Note:** This script could obviously be destructive, so please read it carefully before executing.

```sql
DO $$
DECLARE
    view_name TEXT;
    schema_name_var TEXT;
BEGIN
    -- Drop all views from the 'ponder' schema
    FOR view_name IN SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.views WHERE table_schema = 'ponder'
    LOOP
        EXECUTE format('DROP VIEW IF EXISTS ponder.%I CASCADE', view_name);
        RAISE NOTICE 'Dropped view "ponder"."%"', view_name;
    END LOOP;

    -- Drop the 'ponder_cache' schema
    EXECUTE 'DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS ponder_cache CASCADE';
    RAISE NOTICE 'Dropped schema "ponder_cache"';

    -- Find and drop any 'ponder_instance_*' schemas
    FOR schema_name_var IN SELECT schema_name AS schema_name_alias FROM information_schema.schemata WHERE schema_name LIKE 'ponder_instance_%'
    LOOP
        EXECUTE format('DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS %I CASCADE', schema_name_var);
        RAISE NOTICE 'Dropped schema "%"', schema_name_var;
    END LOOP;
END $$;
```

## 0.3.0

No breaking API changes.

### Moved SQLite directory

**Note:** This release busted the SQLite sync cache.

The SQLite database was moved from the `.ponder/store` directory to `.ponder/sqlite`. The old `.ponder/store` directory will still be used by older versions.

### Moved Postgres sync tables

Similar to SQLite, the sync tables for Postgres were moved from the `public` schema to `ponder_sync`. Now, Ponder does not use the `public` schema whatsoever.

This change did NOT bust the sync cache; the tables were actually moved. This process emits some `WARN`-level logs that you should see after upgrading.

## 0.2.0

### Replaced `p.bytes()` with `p.hex()`

Removed `p.bytes()` in favor of a new `p.hex()` primitive column type. `p.hex()` is suitable for Ethereum addresses and other hex-encoded data, including EVM `bytes` types. `p.hex()` values are stored as `bytea` (Postgres) or `blob` (SQLite). To migrate, replace each occurence of `p.bytes()` in `ponder.schema.ts` with `p.hex()`, and ensure that any values you pass into hex columns are valid hexadecimal strings. The GraphQL API returns `p.hex()` values as hexadecimal strings, and allows sorting/filtering on `p.hex()` columns using the numeric comparison operators (`gt`, `gte`, `le`, `lte`).

### Cursor pagination

Updated the GraphQL API to use cursor pagination instead of offset pagination. Note that this change also affects the `findMany` database method. See the [GraphQL pagination docs](/docs/query/graphql#pagination) for more details.

## 0.1.0

Config

- In general, `ponder.config.ts` now has much more static validation using TypeScript. This includes network names in `contracts`, ABI event names for the contract `event` and `factory` options, and more.
- The `networks` and `contracts` fields were changed from an array to an object. The network or contract name is now specified using an object property name. The `name` field for both networks and contracts was removed.
- The `filter` field has been removed. To index all events matching a specific signature across all contract addresses, add a contract that specifies the `event` field without specifying an `address`.
- The `abi` field now requires an ABI object that has been asserted as const (cannot use a file path). See the ABIType documentation for more details.

Schema

- The schema definition API was rebuilt from scratch to use a TypeScript file `ponder.schema.ts` instead of `schema.graphql`. The `ponder.schema.ts` file has static validation using TypeScript.
- Note that it is possible to convert a `schema.graphql` file into a `ponder.schema.ts` file without introducing any breaking changes to the autogenerated GraphQL API schema.
- Please see the `design your schema` guide for an overview of the new API.

Indexing functions

- `event.params` was renamed to `event.args` to better match Ethereum terminology norms.
- If a contract uses the `event` option, only the specified events will be available for registration. Before, all events in the ABI were available.
- `context.models` was renamed to `context.db`
- Now, a read-only Viem client is available at `context.client`. This client uses the same transport you specify in `ponder.config.ts`, except all method are cached to speed up subsequent indexing.
- The `context.contracts` object now contains the contract addresses and ABIs specified in`ponder.config.ts`, typed as strictly as possible. (You should not need to copy addresses and ABIs around anymore, just use `context.contracts`).
- A new `context.network` object was added which contains the network name and chain ID that the current event is from.

Multi-chain indexing

- The contract `network` field `ponder.config.ts` was upgraded to support an object of network-specific overrides. This is a much better DX for indexing the same contract on multiple chains.
- The options that you can specify per-network are `address`, `event`, `startBlock`, `endBlock`, and `factory`.
- When you add a contract on multiple networks, Ponder will sync the contract on each network you specify. Any indexing functions you register for the contract will now process events across all networks.
- The `context.network` object is typed according to the networks that the current contract runs on, so you can write network-specific logic like `if (context.network.name === “optimism”) { …`

Vite

- Ponder now uses Vite to transform and load your code. This means you can import files from outside the project root directory.
- Vite’s module graph makes it possible to invalidate project files granularly, only reloading the specific parts of your app that need to be updated when a specific file changes. For example, if you save a change to one of your ABI files, `ponder.config.ts` will reload because it imports that file, but your schema will not reload.
- This update also unblocks a path towards concurrent indexing and granular caching of indexing function results.
