# Direct SQL queries

This guide describes how to query the database directly using psql or Drizzle.

<Callout type="warning">
  Don't write to onchain tables from external clients. Only write to onchain
  tables from indexing functions.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  Direct SQL queries against PGlite are
  [possible](https://github.com/supabase-community/pg-gateway?tab=readme-ov-file#pglite),
  but the methods described here do not work out of the box.
</Callout>

## psql

You can also use [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html), a terminal-based Postgres front-end, to query the database from the command line.

<Steps>

### Connection string

Connect using the same connection string that your Ponder app uses.

```bash filename="shell"
psql 'postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/your_database'
```

### Display tables

Use the `\dt` command to list all tables in the `public` schema. If you are using a schema other than `public`, include the pattern.

<div className="code-columns">

```bash filename="psql"
\dt
```

```bash filename="psql"
\dt my_schema.*
```

</div>

The `reorg` tables are used by Ponder internally during reorg reconciliation, and the `_ponder_meta` table is used to store metadata about the database state.

```plaintext filename="psql (result)"
                    List of relations
 Schema | Name                        | Type  | Owner
--------+-----------------------------+-------+----------
 public | accounts                    | table | username
 public | transfer_events             | table | username
 public | _ponder_meta                | table | username
 public | _reorg__accounts            | table | username
 public | _reorg__transfer_events     | table | username
(5 rows)
```

### Select rows

Select a few rows from the `accounts` table.

```sql filename="psql"
SELECT * FROM accounts LIMIT 5;
```

```plaintext filename="psql (result)"
                  address                   |         balance         |
--------------------------------------------+-------------------------+
 0xf73fe15cfb88ea3c7f301f16ade3c02564aca407 | 10000000000000000000000 |
 0xb0659bc97ed61b37d6b140f3e12a41d471781714 | 20000000000000000000000 |
 0x52932f5b2767d917c3134140168f2176c94e8b2c | 10000000000000000000000 |
 0xfb7ca75b3ce099120602b5ab7104cff030ee43f8 |                       0 |
 0x9ccc6c5a9d25429f55ad9af6363c1c4f16b179ad |  7000000000000000000000 |
(5 rows)
```

### Aggregate data

Find the total number of transfers sent to each account.

```sql filename="psql"
SELECT "to", COUNT(*) AS transfer_count
  FROM transfer_events
  GROUP BY "to"
  ORDER BY transfer_count DESC
  LIMIT 5;
```

```plaintext filename="psql (result)"
                     to                     | transfer_count
--------------------------------------------+----------------
 0x5d752f322befb038991579972e912b02f61a3dda |           2342
 0x1337f7970e8399ccbc625647fce58a9dada5aa66 |            313
 0x9726041047644626468922598128349778349982 |            306
 0x27239549dd40e1d60f5b80b0c4196923745b1fd2 |            256
 0x450638daf0caedbdd9f8cb4a41fa1b24788b123e |            238
(5 rows)
```

</Steps>

## Drizzle

<Callout type="warning">
  As of `0.8`, the `onchainTable` objects are not automatically aware of the
  database schema that your instance is using. To get this working, you'll need
  to 1) use the `public` schema or 2) set the connection search path to the
  schema that your instance is using. We're tracking this issue
  [here](https://github.com/ponder-sh/ponder/issues/1325).
</Callout>

The `onchainTable` objects exported by `ponder.schema.ts` are valid Drizzle table objects. You can import them from TypeScript files outside the Ponder `src/` directory and use them with the Drizzle query builder.

Here's a script that creates a Drizzle client and runs a query against the Ponder tables. Be sure to connect to the database using the same `DATABASE_URL` as the Ponder app.

```ts filename="query.ts"
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/node-postgres";
import * as schema from "../../ponder/ponder.schema";

const db = drizzle(process.env.DATABASE_URL, { schema, casing: "snake_case" });

// Select
const oldAccounts = await db
  .select()
  .from(schema.accounts)
  .orderBy(asc(schema.accounts.createdAt))
  .limit(100);

// Query
const whalesWithTransfers = await db.query.accounts.findMany({
  where: (accounts, { eq }) => eq(accounts.balance, 1_000_000n),
  with: { transferEvents: true },
});
```
