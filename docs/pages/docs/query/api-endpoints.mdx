# API endpoints [Customize the HTTP server]

Ponder supports **custom API endpoints** with direct access to the database and other useful resources.

Custom API endpoints offer more flexibility than GraphQL or SQL client queries, making it possible to serve web requests with complex SQL queries, data from external sources, authentication, and more.

## Guide

::::steps

### Open `src/api/index.ts`

Ponder's API server uses [Hono](https://hono.dev/), a fast and lightweight HTTP router. The `src/api/index.ts` file **must** default export a Hono instance.

```ts [src/api/index.ts (minimal)]
import { Hono } from "hono";

const app = new Hono();

export default app;
```

### Register a route handler

To customize the server, register routes and middleware on the Hono instance before exporting it.

```ts [src/api/index.ts]
import { Hono } from "hono";

const app = new Hono();

app.get("/hello", (c) => {
  // [!code focus]
  return c.text("Hello, world!"); // [!code focus]
}); // [!code focus]

export default app;
```

### Test the endpoint

To test the endpoint, start the development server and visit the route in your browser.

```text [Response]
Hello, world!
```

Hono supports all HTTP methods, custom middleware, cookies, JSX, and more. Visit the [Hono documentation](https://hono.dev/docs) for more details.

## Resources

The `ponder:api` virtual module includes useful resources for custom API endpoints.

### Database queries

The `db` object exported from `ponder:api` is a ready-to-use Drizzle database instance. This is the same database instance that powers GraphQL and SQL client queries.

Use the `db` object to run read-only SQL queries within custom API endpoints.

```ts [src/api/index.ts]
import { db } from "ponder:api"; // [!code focus]
import { accounts } from "ponder:schema";
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { eq } from "ponder";

const app = new Hono();

app.get("/account/:address", async (c) => {
  const address = c.req.param("address");

  const account = await db // [!code focus]
    .select() // [!code focus]
    .from(accounts) // [!code focus]
    .where(eq(accounts.address, address)); // [!code focus]

  return c.json(account);
});

export default app;
```

### RPC requests

The `publicClients` object exported from `ponder:api` is a collection of Viem [Public Client](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/public) objects â€” one for each chain defined in `ponder.config.ts`, using the same transports.

Use these clients to make RPC requests within custom API endpoints. Note that the `publicClients` object is keyed by chain ID, not chain name.

```ts [src/api/index.ts]
import { publicClients } from "ponder:api"; // [!code focus]
import { Hono } from "hono";

const app = new Hono();

app.get("/balance/:address", async (c) => {
  const address = c.req.param("address");

  const balance = await publicClients[8453].getBalance({ address }); // [!code focus]

  return c.json({ address, balance });
});

export default app;
```
