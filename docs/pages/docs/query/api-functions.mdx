# API functions

**API functions** are user-defined TypeScript functions that handle web requests. You can use them to customize the API layer of your app with complex SQL queries, authentication, data from external sources, and more.

API functions are built on top of [Hono](https://hono.dev/), a fast and lightweight routing framework.

## Example projects

These example apps demonstrate how to use API functions.

- [**Basic**](https://github.com/ponder-sh/ponder/tree/main/examples/feature-api-functions/src/api/index.ts) - An ERC20 app that responds to `GET` requests and uses [Drizzle](#query-the-database) to build custom SQL queries.
- [**With offchain data**](https://github.com/ponder-sh/ponder/tree/main/examples/with-offchain/src/api/index.ts) - An app that includes data from offchain sources.

## Get started

<Steps>

### Create `src/api/index.ts` file

To enable API functions, create a file named `src/api/index.ts` with the following code. You can register API functions in any `.ts` file in the `src/api/` directory.

```ts filename="src/api/index.ts"
import { Hono } from "hono";

const app = new Hono();

app.get("/hello", (c) => {
  return c.text("Hello, world!");
});

export default app;
```

### Send a request

Visit `http://localhost:42069/hello` in your browser to see the response.

```plaintext filename="Response"
Hello, world!
```

### Register GraphQL middleware

<Callout type="warning">
  Starting from version `0.9.0`, API functions are required and no GraphQL API
  is served by default.
</Callout>

To use the standard GraphQL API, register the `graphql` middleware exported from `ponder`. [Read more](/docs/query/graphql) about GraphQL in Ponder.

```ts filename="src/api/index.ts" {4,8-9}
import { db } from "ponder:api";
import schema from "ponder:schema";
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { graphql } from "ponder";

const app = new Hono();

app.use("/", graphql({ db, schema }));
app.use("/graphql", graphql({ db, schema }));

export default app;
```

</Steps>

## Query the database

The API function context includes a ready-to-use Drizzle database client exported from `ponder:api`. To query the database, import table objects from `ponder:schema` and pass them to `db.select()` or use relational queries.

### Select

Here's a simple query using the Drizzle `select` query builder.

```ts filename="src/api/index.ts"
import { db } from "ponder:api";
import schema from "ponder:schema";
import { Hono } from "hono";

const app = new Hono();

app.get("/account/:address", async (c) => {
  const address = c.req.param("address");

  const account = await db
    .select()
    .from(schema.accounts)
    .where(eq(schema.accounts.address, address))
    .limit(1);

  return c.json(account);
});

export default app;
```

To build more complex queries, use `join`, `groupBy`, `where`, `orderBy`, `limit`, and other methods. Drizzle's filter & conditional operators (like `eq`, `gte`, and `or`) are re-exported by `ponder`. Visit the Drizzle [documentation](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/select) for more details.

### Relational queries

Drizzle's relational query builder (AKA Drizzle Queries) offers a great developer experience for complex queries. The `db.query` object exposes the raw Drizzle relational query builder.

Here's an example that uses the relational query builder in an API function to find the 10 largest trades in the past hour joined with the account that made the trade. Visit the Drizzle Queries [documentation](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/rqb) for more details.

```ts filename="src/api/index.ts"
import { db } from "ponder:api";
import { accounts, tradeEvents } from "ponder:schema";
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { eq, and, gte, inArray, sql } from "drizzle-orm";

const app = new Hono();

app.get("/hot-trades", async (c) => {
  const trades = await db.query.tradeEvents.findMany({
    where: (table, { gt, gte, and }) =>
      and(
        gt(table.amount, 1_000n),
        gte(table.timestamp, Date.now() - 1000 * 60 * 60)
      ),
    limit: 10,
    with: { account: true },
  });

  return c.json(trades);
});

export default app;
```

### Send RPC requests

The API function context also includes a [Viem client](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/public) for each network defined in `ponder.config.ts`.

```ts filename="src/api/index.ts" {1,11}
import { publicClients, db } from "ponder:api";
import schema from "ponder:schema";
import { Hono } from "hono";

const app = new Hono();

app.get("/account/:chainId/:address", async (c) => {
  const chainId = c.req.param("chainId");
  const address = c.req.param("address");

  const balance = await publicClients[chainId].getBalance({ address });

  const account = await db.query.accounts.findFirst({
    where: eq(schema.accounts.address, address),
  });

  return c.json({ balance, account });
});

export default app;
```

## Reserved routes

If you register API functions that conflict with these internal routes, the build will fail.

- `/health`: Returns a `200` status code immediately after the app starts running. [Read more](/docs/production/deploy#healthchecks) about healthchecks.
- `/ready`: Returns a `200` status code after the app has completed the historical backfill and is available to serve traffic. [Read more](/docs/production/deploy#healthchecks) about heatlthchecks.
- `/metrics`: Returns Prometheus metrics. [Read more](/docs/advanced/metrics) about metrics.
- `/status`: Returns indexing status object. [Read more](/docs/advanced/status) about indexing status.
