# API functions

**API functions** are user-defined TypeScript functions that handle web requests. You can use them to customize the API layer of your app with complex SQL queries, authentication, data from external sources, and more.

API functions are built on top of [Hono](https://hono.dev/), a fast and lightweight routing framework.

## Example projects

These example apps demonstrate how to use API functions.

- [**Basic**](https://github.com/ponder-sh/ponder/tree/main/examples/feature-api-functions/src/api/index.ts) - An ERC20 app that responds to `GET` requests and uses [Drizzle](#query-the-database) to build custom SQL queries.
- [**tRPC**](https://github.com/ponder-sh/ponder/tree/main/examples/with-trpc/client/index.ts) - An app that creates a [tRPC](https://trpc.io) server and a script that uses a tRPC client with end-to-end type safety.

## Get started

<Steps>

### Upgrade to `>=0.5.0`

API functions are available starting from version `0.5.0`. Read the [migration guide](/docs/migration-guide#050) for more details.

### Create `src/api/index.ts` file

To enable API functions, create a file named `src/api/index.ts` with the following code. You can register API functions in any `.ts` file in the `src/api/` directory.

```ts filename="src/api/index.ts"
import { ponder } from "@/generated";

ponder.get("/hello", (c) => {
  return c.text("Hello, world!");
});
```

### Send a request

Visit `http://localhost:42069/hello` in your browser to see the response.

```plaintext filename="Response"
Hello, world!
```

### Register GraphQL middleware

<Callout type="warning">
  Once you create an API function file, you have "opted in" to API functions and
  your app **will not** serve the standard GraphQL API by default.
</Callout>

To continue using the standard GraphQL API, register the `graphql` middleware exported from `@ponder/core`.

```ts filename="src/api/index.ts" {2,4-5}
import { ponder } from "@/generated";
import { graphql } from "@ponder/core";

ponder.use("/", graphql());
ponder.use("/graphql", graphql());

// ...
```

</Steps>

## Query the database

The API function context includes a ready-to-use Drizzle database client at `c.db`. To query the database, import table objects from `ponder.schema.ts` and pass them to `c.db.select()` or use relational queries.

### Select

Here's a simple query using the Drizzle `select` query builder.

```ts filename="src/api/index.ts"
import { ponder } from "@/generated";
import { accounts } from "../../ponder.schema";

ponder.get("/account/:address", async (c) => {
  const address = c.req.param("address");

  const account = await c.db
    .select()
    .from(accounts)
    .where(eq(accounts.address, address))
    .limit(1);

  return c.json(account);
});
```

To build more complex queries, use `join`, `groupBy`, `where`, `orderBy`, `limit`, and other methods. Drizzle's filter & conditional operators (like `eq`, `gte`, and `or`) are re-exported by `@ponder/core`. Visit the Drizzle [documentation](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/select) for more details.

### Relational queries

Drizzle's relational query builder (AKA Drizzle Queries) offers a great developer experience for complex queries. The `c.db.query` object exposes the raw Drizzle relational query builder.

Here's an example that uses the relational query builder in an API function to find the 10 largest trades in the past hour joined with the account that made the trade. Visit the Drizzle Queries [documentation](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/rqb) for more details.

```ts filename="src/api/index.ts"
import { accounts, tradeEvents } from "../ponder.schema";
import { eq, and, gte, inArray, sql } from "drizzle-orm";

ponder.get("/hot-trades", async (c) => {
  const trades = await c.db.query.tradeEvents.findMany({
    where: (table, { gt, gte, and }) =>
      and(
        gt(table.amount, 1_000n),
        gte(table.timestamp, Date.now() - 1000 * 60 * 60)
      ),
    limit: 10,
    with: { account: true },
  });

  return c.json(trades);
});
```

## API reference

### `get()`

Use `ponder.get()` to handle HTTP `GET` requests. The `c` context object contains the request, response helpers, and the database connection.

```ts filename="src/api/index.ts" {5}
import { ponder } from "@/generated";
import { eq } from "@ponder/core";
import { accounts } from "../../ponder.schema";

ponder.get("/account/:address", async (c) => {
  const address = c.req.param("address");

  const account = await c.db
    .select()
    .from(accounts)
    .where(eq(accounts.address, address))
    .first();

  if (account) {
    return c.json(account);
  } else {
    return c.status(404).json({ error: "Account not found" });
  }
});
```

### `post()`

<Callout type="info">
  API functions cannot write to the database, even when handling `POST`
  requests.
</Callout>

Use `ponder.post()` to handle HTTP `POST` requests.

In this example, we calculate the volume of transfers for each recipient within a given time range. The `fromTimestamp` and `toTimestamp` parameters are passed in the request body.

```ts filename="src/api/index.ts" {5}
import { ponder } from "@/generated";
import { and, gte, sum } from "@ponder/core";
import { transferEvents } from "../../ponder.schema";

ponder.post("/volume", async (c) => {
  const body = await c.req.json();
  const { fromTimestamp, toTimestamp } = body;

  const volumeChartData = await c.db
    .select({
      to: transferEvents.toId,
      volume: sum(transferEvents.amount),
    })
    .from(transferEvents)
    .groupBy(transferEvents.toId)
    .where(
      and(
        gte(transferEvents.timestamp, fromTimestamp),
        lte(transferEvents.timestamp, toTimestamp)
      )
    )
    .limit(1);

  return c.json(volumeChartData);
});
```

### `use()`

Use `ponder.use(...){:ts}` to add middleware to your API functions. Middleware functions can modify the request and response objects, add logs, authenticate requests, and more. [Read more](https://hono.dev/docs/guides/middleware) about Hono middleware.

```ts filename="src/api/index.ts" {3}
import { ponder } from "@/generated";

ponder.use((c, next) => {
  console.log("Request received:", c.req.url);
  return next();
});
```

### `hono`

Use `ponder.hono` to access the underlying Hono instance.

```ts filename="src/api/index.ts" {3}
import { ponder } from "@/generated";

ponder.hono.notFound((c) => {
  return c.text("Custom 404 Message", 404);
});

// ...
```

## Reserved routes

If you register API functions that conflict with these internal routes, the build will fail.

- `/health`: Returns a `200` status code immediately after the app starts running. [Read more](/docs/production/deploy#healthchecks) about healthchecks.
- `/ready`: Returns a `200` status code after the app has completed the historical backfill and is available to serve traffic. [Read more](/docs/production/deploy#healthchecks) about heatlthchecks.
- `/metrics`: Returns Prometheus metrics. [Read more](/docs/advanced/metrics) about metrics.
- `/status`: Returns indexing status object. [Read more](/docs/advanced/status) about indexing status.
