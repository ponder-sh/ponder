# Indexing function API

Indexing functions are user-defined functions that receive blockchain data (a log, block, or trace) and insert data into the database. You can register indexing functions within any `.ts` file inside the `src/` directory.

## Registration

To register an indexing function, use the `.on(){:ts}` method of the `ponder` object exported from `"@/generated"{:ts}`.

<Callout type="info">
  Values returned by indexing functions are ignored.
</Callout>

```ts filename="src/index.ts" {3}
import { ponder } from "@/generated";

ponder.on("ContractName:EventName", async ({ event, context }) => {
  const { args, log, block, transaction } = event;
  const { db, network, client, contracts } = context;

  // ...
});
```

## Log event

The `event` argument contains the decoded log arguments and the raw log, block, and transaction.

```ts
type LogEvent = {
  name: string;
  args: Args;
  log: Log;
  block: Block;
  transaction: Transaction;
};
```

### Log event arguments

The `event.args` object contains event log arguments decoded using Viem's [decodeEventLog](https://viem.sh/docs/contract/decodeEventLog.html) function.

```ts
/** Sample `args` type for an ERC20 Transfer event. */
type Args = {
  from: `0x${string}`;
  to: `0x${string}`;
  value: bigint;
};
```

### Raw log, block, and transaction

The `event.block`, `event.transaction`, and `event.log` objects contain raw blockchain data.

```ts filename="Block, transaction, and log types"
/** The log being processed. */
type Log = {
  /** Globally unique identifier for this log (`${blockHash}-${logIndex}`). */
  id: string;
  /** The address from which this log originated */
  address: `0x${string}`;
  /** Hash of block containing this log */
  blockHash: `0x${string}`;
  /** Number of block containing this log */
  blockNumber: bigint;
  /** Contains the non-indexed arguments of the log */
  data: `0x${string}`;
  /** Index of this log within its block */
  logIndex: number;
  /** `true` if this log has been removed in a chain reorganization */
  removed: boolean;
  /** List of order-dependent topics */
  topics: [`0x${string}`, ...`0x${string}`[]] | [];
  /** Hash of the transaction that created this log */
  transactionHash: `0x${string}`;
  /** Index of the transaction that created this log */
  transactionIndex: number;
};

/** The block containing the transaction that emitted the log being processed. */
type Block = {
  /** Base fee per gas */
  baseFeePerGas: bigint | null;
  /** "Extra data" field of this block */
  extraData: `0x${string}`;
  /** Maximum gas allowed in this block */
  gasLimit: bigint;
  /** Total used gas by all transactions in this block */
  gasUsed: bigint;
  /** Block hash */
  hash: `0x${string}`;
  /** Logs bloom filter */
  logsBloom: `0x${string}`;
  /** Address that received this block’s mining rewards */
  miner: `0x${string}`;
  /** Block number */
  number: bigint;
  /** Parent block hash */
  parentHash: `0x${string}`;
  /** Root of the this block’s receipts trie */
  receiptsRoot: `0x${string}`;
  /** Size of this block in bytes */
  size: bigint;
  /** Root of this block’s final state trie */
  stateRoot: `0x${string}`;
  /** Unix timestamp of when this block was collated */
  timestamp: bigint;
  /** Total difficulty of the chain until this block */
  totalDifficulty: bigint | null;
  /** Root of this block’s transaction trie */
  transactionsRoot: `0x${string}`;
};

/** The transaction that emitted the log being processed. */
type Transaction = {
  /** Hash of block containing this transaction */
  blockHash: `0x${string}`;
  /** Number of block containing this transaction */
  blockNumber: bigint;
  /** Transaction sender */
  from: `0x${string}`;
  /** Gas provided for transaction execution */
  gas: bigint;
  /** Base fee per gas. */
  gasPrice?: bigint | undefined;
  /** Hash of this transaction */
  hash: `0x${string}`;
  /** Contract code or a hashed method call */
  input: `0x${string}`;
  /** Total fee per gas in wei (gasPrice/baseFeePerGas + maxPriorityFeePerGas). */
  maxFeePerGas?: bigint | undefined;
  /** Max priority fee per gas (in wei). */
  maxPriorityFeePerGas?: bigint | undefined;
  /** Unique number identifying this transaction */
  nonce: number;
  /** Transaction recipient or `null` if deploying a contract */
  to: `0x${string}` | null;
  /** Index of this transaction in the block */
  transactionIndex: number;
  /** Value in wei sent with this transaction */
  value: bigint;
};
```

### Transaction receipt

The `event.transactionReceipt{:ts}` object contains details about the transaction associated with the current log or trace. To enable transaction receipts, set `includeTransactionReceipts{:ts}` to `true{:ts}` in the contract config. [Read more](/docs/contracts-and-networks#transaction-receipts).

```ts filename="Block, transaction, and log types"
/** A confirmed Ethereum transaction receipt. */
export type TransactionReceipt = {
  /** Hash of block containing this transaction */
  blockHash: Hash;
  /** Number of block containing this transaction */
  blockNumber: bigint;
  /** Address of new contract or `null` if no contract was created */
  contractAddress: Address | null;
  /** Gas used by this and all preceding transactions in this block */
  cumulativeGasUsed: bigint;
  /** Pre-London, it is equal to the transaction's gasPrice. Post-London, it is equal to the actual gas price paid for inclusion. */
  effectiveGasPrice: bigint;
  /** Transaction sender */
  from: Address;
  /** Gas used by this transaction */
  gasUsed: bigint;
  /** List of log objects generated by this transaction */
  logs: Log[];
  /** Logs bloom filter */
  logsBloom: Hex;
  /** `success` if this transaction was successful or `reverted` if it failed */
  status: "success" | "reverted";
  /** Transaction recipient or `null` if deploying a contract */
  to: Address | null;
  /** Hash of this transaction */
  transactionHash: Hash;
  /** Index of this transaction in the block */
  transactionIndex: number;
  /** Transaction type */
  type: TransactionType;
};
```

## Context

The `context` argument passed to each indexing function contains database model objects and helper objects based on your config.

At runtime, the indexing engine uses a different `context` object depending on the network the current event was emitted on. The TypeScript types for the `context` object reflect this by creating a union of possible types for `context.network` and `context.contracts`.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts
type Context = {
  db: Database;
  network: { name: string; chainId: number };
  client: ReadOnlyClient;
  contracts: Record<
    string,
    { abi: Abi; address?: `0x${string}`; startBlock?: number; endBlock?: number; }
  >;
};
```

### Database

The `context.db` object is a live database connection. [Read more](/docs/indexing/write-to-the-database) about writing to the database.

```ts filename="src/index.ts" {5-7}
import { ponder } from "@/generated";
import { persons, dogs } from "../ponder.schema";

ponder.on("Neighborhood:NewNeighbor", async ({ event, context }) => {
  await context.db.insert(persons).values({ name: "bob", age: 30 });
  await context.db.insert(dogs).values({ name: "jake", ownerName: "bob" });
  const jake = await context.db.find(dogs, { name: "jake" });
});
```

### Network

The `context.network` object includes information about the network that the current event is from. The object is strictly typed according to the networks you defined in your config.

```ts filename="src/index.ts"
ponder.on("UniswapV3Factory:Ownership", async ({ event, context }) => {
  context.network;
  //      ^? { name: "mainnet", chainId 1 } | { name: "base", chainId 8453 }

  if (context.network.name === "mainnet") {
    // Do mainnet-specific stuff!
  }
});
```

## `"setup"` event

You can also define a setup function for each contract that runs before indexing begins.

- The indexing function does not receive an `event` argument, only `context`.
- If you read from contracts in a `"setup"` indexing function, the `blockNumber` for the request is set to the contract's `startBlock`.

For example, you might have a singleton `World` record that occasionally gets updated in indexing functions.

```ts filename="src/index.ts"
import { ponder } from "@/generated";
import { world } from "../ponder.schema";

ponder.on("FunGame:NewPlayer", async ({ context }) => {
  await context.db
    .insert(world)
    .values({ id: 1, playerCount: 0 })
    .onConflictDoUpdate((row) => ({
      playerCount: row.playerCount + 1,
    }));
});
```

Without the `"setup"` event, you need to upsert the record in each indexing function that attempts to use it, which is clunky and bad for performance. Instead, use the `"setup"` event to create the singleton record once at the beginning of indexing.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts filename="src/index.ts"
import { ponder } from "@/generated";
import { world } from "../ponder.schema";

ponder.on("FunGame:setup", async ({ context }) => {
  await context.db.insert(world).values({
    id: 1,
    playerCount: 0,
  });
});

ponder.on("FunGame:NewPlayer", async ({ context }) => {
  await context.db
    .update(world, { id: 1 })
    .set((row) => ({
      playerCount: row.playerCount + 1,
  }));
});
```
