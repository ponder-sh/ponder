# Indexing function API

Indexing functions are user-defined functions that process blockchain data. They can be registered within any `.ts` file inside the `src/` directory. There are two kinds of events: **log events** and the **`"setup"` event**.

## Registration

To register an indexing function, use the `.on(){:ts}` method of the `ponder` object exported from `"@/generated"{:ts}`.

Ponder uses

<Callout type="info">
  Values returned by indexing functions are ignored.
</Callout>

```ts filename="src/index.ts"
import { ponder } from "@/generated";

ponder.on("ContractName:EventName", async ({ event, context }) => {
  const { args, log, block, transaction } = event;
  const { db, network, client, contracts } = context;

  // ...
});
```

## Event

The `event` argument passed to each indexing function contains raw event data.

```ts
type Event = {
  name: string;
  args: Args;
  log: Log;
  block: Block;
  transaction: Transaction;
};
```

### Event arguments

The `event.args` object contains event log arguments decoded using Viem's [decodeEventLog](https://viem.sh/docs/contract/decodeEventLog.html).

```ts
/** Sample `args` type for an ERC20 Transfer event. */
type Args = {
  from: `0x${string}`;
  to: `0x${string}`;
  value: bigint;
};
```

### Block, transaction, and log

The `event.block`, `event.transaction`, and `event.log` objects contain raw blockchain data.

```ts filename="Block, transaction, and log types"
/** The block containing the transaction that emitted the log being processed. */
type Block = {
  /** Base fee per gas */
  baseFeePerGas: bigint | null;
  /** "Extra data" field of this block */
  extraData: `0x${string}`;
  /** Maximum gas allowed in this block */
  gasLimit: bigint;
  /** Total used gas by all transactions in this block */
  gasUsed: bigint;
  /** Block hash */
  hash: `0x${string}`;
  /** Logs bloom filter */
  logsBloom: `0x${string}`;
  /** Address that received this block’s mining rewards */
  miner: `0x${string}`;
  /** Block number */
  number: bigint;
  /** Parent block hash */
  parentHash: `0x${string}`;
  /** Root of the this block’s receipts trie */
  receiptsRoot: `0x${string}`;
  /** Size of this block in bytes */
  size: bigint;
  /** Root of this block’s final state trie */
  stateRoot: `0x${string}`;
  /** Unix timestamp of when this block was collated */
  timestamp: bigint;
  /** Total difficulty of the chain until this block */
  totalDifficulty: bigint | null;
  /** Root of this block’s transaction trie */
  transactionsRoot: `0x${string}`;
};

/** The transaction that emitted the log being processed. */
type Transaction = {
  /** Hash of block containing this transaction */
  blockHash: `0x${string}`;
  /** Number of block containing this transaction */
  blockNumber: bigint;
  /** Transaction sender */
  from: `0x${string}`;
  /** Gas provided for transaction execution */
  gas: bigint;
  /** Base fee per gas. */
  gasPrice?: bigint | undefined;
  /** Hash of this transaction */
  hash: `0x${string}`;
  /** Contract code or a hashed method call */
  input: `0x${string}`;
  /** Total fee per gas in wei (gasPrice/baseFeePerGas + maxPriorityFeePerGas). */
  maxFeePerGas?: bigint | undefined;
  /** Max priority fee per gas (in wei). */
  maxPriorityFeePerGas?: bigint | undefined;
  /** Unique number identifying this transaction */
  nonce: number;
  /** Transaction recipient or `null` if deploying a contract */
  to: `0x${string}` | null;
  /** Index of this transaction in the block */
  transactionIndex: number;
  /** Value in wei sent with this transaction */
  value: bigint;
};

/** The log being processed. */
type Log = {
  /** Globally unique identifier for this log (`${blockHash}-${logIndex}`). */
  id: string;
  /** The address from which this log originated */
  address: `0x${string}`;
  /** Hash of block containing this log */
  blockHash: `0x${string}`;
  /** Number of block containing this log */
  blockNumber: bigint;
  /** Contains the non-indexed arguments of the log */
  data: `0x${string}`;
  /** Index of this log within its block */
  logIndex: number;
  /** `true` if this log has been removed in a chain reorganization */
  removed: boolean;
  /** List of order-dependent topics */
  topics: [`0x${string}`, ...`0x${string}`[]] | [];
  /** Hash of the transaction that created this log */
  transactionHash: `0x${string}`;
  /** Index of the transaction that created this log */
  transactionIndex: number;
};
```

### Transaction receipt

The `event.transactionReceipt{:ts}` object contains details about the transaction associated with the current log or trace. To enable transaction receipts, set `includeTransactionReceipts{:ts}` to `true{:ts}` in the contract config. [Read more](/docs/contracts-and-networks#transaction-receipts).

```ts filename="Block, transaction, and log types"
/** A confirmed Ethereum transaction receipt. */
export type TransactionReceipt = {
  /** Hash of block containing this transaction */
  blockHash: Hash;
  /** Number of block containing this transaction */
  blockNumber: bigint;
  /** Address of new contract or `null` if no contract was created */
  contractAddress: Address | null;
  /** Gas used by this and all preceding transactions in this block */
  cumulativeGasUsed: bigint;
  /** Pre-London, it is equal to the transaction's gasPrice. Post-London, it is equal to the actual gas price paid for inclusion. */
  effectiveGasPrice: bigint;
  /** Transaction sender */
  from: Address;
  /** Gas used by this transaction */
  gasUsed: bigint;
  /** List of log objects generated by this transaction */
  logs: Log[];
  /** Logs bloom filter */
  logsBloom: Hex;
  /** `success` if this transaction was successful or `reverted` if it failed */
  status: "success" | "reverted";
  /** Transaction recipient or `null` if deploying a contract */
  to: Address | null;
  /** Hash of this transaction */
  transactionHash: Hash;
  /** Index of this transaction in the block */
  transactionIndex: number;
  /** Transaction type */
  type: TransactionType;
};
```

## Context

The `context` argument passed to each indexing function contains database model objects and helper objects based on your config.

At runtime, the indexing engine uses a different `context` object depending on the network the current event was emitted on. The TypeScript types for the `context` object reflect this by creating a union of possible types for `context.network` and `context.contracts`.

```ts
type Context = {
  db: Record<string, DatabaseModel>;
  network: { name: string; chainId: number };
  client: ReadOnlyClient;
  contracts: Record<
    string,
    {
      abi: Abi;
      address?: `0x${string}`;
      startBlock?: number;
      endBlock?: number;
    }
  >;
};
```

### Database

The `context.db` object contains ORM-style models that can be used to create, read, update, and delete database records. See [Create & update records](/docs/indexing/create-update-records) for a detailed overview.

<div className="code-columns">

```ts filename="ponder.schema.ts"
import { createSchema } from "@ponder/core";

export default createSchema((p) => ({
  Person: p.createTable({
    id: p.string(),
    age: p.int().optional(),
  }),
  Dog: p.createTable({
    id: p.bigint(),
    ownerId: p.string().references("Person.id"),
  }),
}));
```

```ts filename="src/index.ts"
import { ponder } from "@/generated";

ponder.on("UniswapV3Factory:Ownership", async ({ event, context }) => {
  const { Person } = context.db;
  //      ^? Model<{ id: string; age?: number }>;
  const { Dog } = context.db;
  //      ^? Model<{ id: bigint; ownerId: string; }>;
});
```

</div>

### Network

The `context.network` object contains information about the network that the current event was emitted on. The name and chain ID properties are strictly typed as a union of possible values based on the networks that the contract is configured to run on.

```ts filename="src/index.ts"
ponder.on("UniswapV3Factory:Ownership", async ({ event, context }) => {
  context.network;
  //      ^? { name: "mainnet", chainId 1 } | { name: "base", chainId 8453 }

  if (context.network.name === "mainnet") {
    // Do mainnet-specific stuff!
  }
});
```

## `"setup"` event

You can also define a setup function for each contract that runs before indexing begins.

- The indexing function does not receive an `event` argument, only `context`.
- If you read from contracts in a `"setup"` indexing function, the `blockNumber` for the request is set to the contract's `startBlock`.

For example, you might have a singleton `World` record that gets updated in indexing functions. Without the `"setup"` event, you would need to upsert the record in each indexing function that attempts to use it, which is clunky and inefficient.

<div className="code-columns">

```ts filename="src/index.ts"
import { ponder } from "@/generated";

ponder.on("FunGame:NewPlayer", async ({ context }) => {
  await context.db.World.upsert({
    id: 1,
    create: { playerCount: 0 },
    update: ({ current }) => ({
      ...current,
      playerCount: current.playerCount + 1,
    }),
  });
});
```

```ts filename="src/index.ts"
import { ponder } from "@/generated";

ponder.on("FunGame:setup", async ({ context }) => {
  await context.db.World.create({
    id: 1,
    data: { playerCount: 0 },
  });
});

ponder.on("FunGame:NewPlayer", async ({ context }) => {
  await context.db.World.update({
    id: 1,
    data: ({ current }) => ({
      ...current,
      playerCount: current.playerCount + 1,
    }),
  });
});
```

</div>
