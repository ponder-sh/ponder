# Call traces

As of `0.4.26`, Ponder supports call trace indexing. Call traces are similar to logs, but they represent a _function call_ instead of an event log.

<Callout type="warning">
  Call traces are slower, more expensive, and less widely supported than logs.
  For new chains, you might struggle to find an RPC provider that supports the
  `trace_filter` and `trace_block` methods.
</Callout>

## Register an indexing function

Call trace indexing is **disabled** by default. To enable it for a contract, set the `includeCallTraces{:ts}` option to `true{:ts}`.

After enabling this option, each function in the contract ABI will become available as an indexing function event name using the `"ContractName.functionName()"{:ts}` scheme.

<div className="code-columns">

```ts filename="ponder.config.ts" {11}
import { createConfig } from "@ponder/core";
import { BlitmapAbi } from "./abis/Blitmap";

export default createConfig({
  contracts: {
    Blitmap: {
      abi: BlitmapAbi,
      network: "mainnet",
      address: "0x8d04a8c79cEB0889Bdd12acdF3Fa9D207eD3Ff63",
      startBlock: 12439123,
      includeCallTraces: true,
    },
  },
  // ...
});
```

```ts filename="src/index.ts" {15}
import { ponder } from "@/generated";

ponder.on("Blitmap.mintOriginal()", async ({ event }) => {
  event.args;
  //    ^? [tokenData: Hex, name: string]
  event.trace.gasUsed;
  //          ^? bigint
});
```

## What is a call trace?

Let's define call traces from three different perspectives:

- **Ponder**: A call trace is similar to a log, but it represents a function call instead of an event log. You can register an indexing function that will run whenever a specific function on one of your contracts gets called.
- **Solidity**: A call trace records a function call. For example, whenever someone calls the `transfer(address to, uint256 amount){:solidity}` function of an ERC20 token contract, it produces a call trace.
- **EVM**: A call trace records the execution of the [`CALL`, `STATICCALL`, `DELEGATECALL`, or `CALLCODE`](https://www.evm.codes/#f1) opcode within a transaction.

### Top-level vs. internal calls

A call trace can be a **top-level call** or an **internal call**. A top-level call is from an externally-owned account, and an internal call is from another contract.

To determine if a specific call trace is a top-level call, use `event.trace.traceAddress.length === 0{:ts}`. Top-level calls also always have `event.trace.to === event.transaction.to{:ts}`, but this can also be true for internal calls.

```ts filename="src/index.ts" {2}
ponder.on("ERC20.transfer()", async ({ event }) => {
  const isTopLevelCall = event.trace.traceAddress.length === 0;
  // ...
});
```

### `eth_call` and `view` functions

The `eth_call` RPC method **does not** produce a call trace. These calls do not occur during the execution of a transaction, so they are not recorded as call traces.

However, calls made to `view` or `pure` functions **do** produce call traces if they are made during the execution of a transaction. These call traces are rarely useful for indexing, but they do happen.

## RPC methods

|            | RPC methods                                    |
| :--------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| Historical | `trace_filter` and `eth_getTransactionReceipt` |
| Realtime   | `trace_block` and `eth_getTransactionReceipt`  |

The sync engine fetches call traces using the `trace_filter` and `trace_block` RPC methods, and uses `eth_getTransactionReceipt` to confirm that a specific call trace did not occur within a reverted transaction.
