# Accounts

Account indexing is useful for activity that is not associated with a specific contract, like transactions and native transfers to and from an address. The key difference between `contracts` and `accounts` in `ponder.config.ts` is that accounts do not have an ABI.

<Callout type="info">
  The standard Ethereum RPC does not support filtering for transactions & native
  transfers. So, account indexing uses a block-by-block approach which is often
  slower than log indexing.
</Callout>

## Quick example

In this example, we'll index transactions sent by the [Beaver](https://beaverbuild.org/) block builder account.

<Steps>

### Add an account

Add the network, address, and start block to the `accounts` field in `ponder.config.ts`.

```ts filename="ponder.config.ts"
import { createConfig } from "ponder";

export default createConfig({
  // ... more config
  accounts: {
    BeaverBuild: {
      network: "mainnet",
      address: "0x95222290DD7278Aa3Ddd389Cc1E1d165CC4BAfe5",
      startBlock: 20000000,
    },
  },
});
```

### Register indexing functions

Register an indexing function for the `transaction:from` event. The framework will fetch all transactions where `transaction.from` matches the account address, then process each one using your indexing function.

```ts filename="src/index.ts" {4}
import { ponder } from "ponder:registry";
import { transactions } from "ponder:schema";

ponder.on("BeaverBuild:transaction:from", async ({ event, context }) => {
  await context.db.insert(transactions).values({
    from: event.transaction.from,
    to: event.transaction.to,
    value: event.transaction.value,
    gasUsed: event.transactionReceipt.gasUsed,
    // ... more fields
  });
});
```

Account indexing also supports the `transaction:to`, `transfer:from`, and `transfer:to` events. [Read more](/docs/api-reference/config#accounts) about event types.

</Steps>

## Account name

Every account must have a unique name, provided as a key to the `accounts` object. Names must be unique across accounts, contracts, and block intervals.

```ts filename="ponder.config.ts" {9}
import { createConfig } from "ponder";
import { http } from "viem";

export default createConfig({
  networks: {
    mainnet: { chainId: 1, transport: http(process.env.PONDER_RPC_URL_1) },
  },
  accounts: {
    BeaverBuild: {
      network: "mainnet",
      address: "0x95222290DD7278Aa3Ddd389Cc1E1d165CC4BAfe5",
      startBlock: 12439123,
    },
  },
});
```

## Network

The `network` option for accounts works the same way as it does for contracts. [Read more](/docs/contracts-and-networks#network).

## Address

The `address` option for accounts works the same way as it does for contracts. You can provide a single address, a list of addresses, or an address factory. You can also specify network-specific overrides. [Read more](/docs/contracts-and-networks#address).

## Block range

The `startBlock` and `endBlock` options for accounts work the same way as it does for contracts. [Read more](/docs/contracts-and-networks#block-range).
