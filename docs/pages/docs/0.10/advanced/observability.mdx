# Observability [Logs, metrics, and indexing status]

## Logs

Ponder produces logs to help you understand and debug your application.

### Log level

There are two ways to configure the minimum log level. If specified, the environment variable takes precedence over the CLI flag.

- Set the `PONDER_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable
- Use the `--log-level <LEVEL>`, `-v` (debug) or `-vv` (trace) CLI option

```js [.env.local]
PONDER_LOG_LEVEL=trace
```

```bash [Terminal]
ponder dev --log-level warn
# or, use the shortcut flag for debug
ponder dev -v
```

#### Levels

| Log level        | Example                                           |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| `silent`         |                                                   |
| `error`          | Unrecoverable RPC error, SQL constraint violation |
| `warn`           | Reorg reconciliation, malformed config            |
| `info` (default) | Indexing progress, real-time block processing     |
| `debug`          | Internal service lifecycle events                 |
| `trace`          | Query-level database logs                         |

#### User logs

Logs produced by your code (e.g. `console.log` statements in `ponder.config.ts` or indexing functions) will always be written to the console. Note that Ponder _does_ catch **errors** thrown by your code and emits an `error` log including the original error message and stack trace.

### Log format

Use the `--log-format <FORMAT>` CLI option to set the log format.

:::info
The auto-updating terminal UI is always enabled during development (`ponder dev`) regardless of the log level or format.
:::

#### Pretty (default)

```bash [Terminal]
ponder start --log-format pretty
```

```bash [Output]
11:54:36 AM INFO  build      Using PGlite database at .ponder/pglite (default)
11:54:36 AM INFO  database   Created table 'Account' in 'public.db'
11:54:36 AM INFO  server     Started listening on port 42069
11:54:36 AM INFO  historical Started syncing 'optimism' logs for 'weth9' with 0.0% cached
11:54:36 AM INFO  historical Started syncing 'base' logs for 'weth9' with 0.0% cached
11:54:36 AM INFO  historical Started syncing 'polygon' logs for 'weth9' with 0.0% cached
```

#### JSON

```bash [Terminal]
ponder start --log-format json
```

The JSON log format emits newline-delimited JSON objects with properties `level`, `time`, `service`, `msg`, and (optionally) `error`.

```json [Output]
{"level":30,"time":1717170664426,"service":"build","msg":"Using PGlite database at .ponder/pglite (default)"}
{"level":30,"time":1717170664454,"service":"database","msg":"Created table 'Account' in 'public.db'"}
{"level":30,"time":1717170664458,"service":"server","msg":"Started listening on port 42069"}
{"level":30,"time":1717170664625,"service":"historical","msg":"Started syncing 'base' logs for 'weth9' with 0.0% cached"}
{"level":30,"time":1717170664628,"service":"historical","msg":"Started syncing 'optimism' logs for 'weth9' with 0.0% cached"}
{"level":30,"time":1717170664683,"service":"historical","msg":"Started syncing 'polygon' logs for 'weth9' with 0.0% cached"}
```

## Metrics

Ponder apps publish Prometheus metrics at the `/metrics` path.

:::warning
Metrics are not part of the public API, so these are subject to change without notice. Do not rely on these metrics for anything important (yet).

## Indexing status

To check the indexing status of your app, use the `/status` endpoint or the `_meta` field in the GraphQL API.

### Usage

Use the indexing status to quickly confirm that Ponder is working as expected. You can also poll the status to confirm that a specific block number has been ingested by Ponder before refetching a query client-side (for example, in a form submit handler).

#### HTTP

```bash [Request]
curl http://localhost:42069/status
```

```json [Response]
{
  "mainnet": {
    "ready": true,
    "block": {
      "number": 20293450,
      "timestamp": 1720823759
    }
  },
  "base": {
    "ready": true,
    "block": {
      "number": 17017206,
      "timestamp": 1720823759
    }
  }
}
```

#### GraphQL

```graphql [Query]
query {
  _meta {
    status
  }
}
```

```json [Result]
{
  "_meta": {
    "status": {
      "mainnet": {
        "ready": true,
        "block": {
          "number": 20293464,
          "timestamp": 1720823939
        }
      },
      "base": {
        "ready": false,
        "block": null
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### API

The response object contains a property for each network in your app with the following fields.

| field     |                       type                       | description                                                                        |
| :-------- | :----------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ready** |                    `boolean`                     | `true` if historical indexing is complete.                                         |
| **block** | `{ number: number; timestamp: number; } \| null` | The most recently indexed block, or `null` if historical indexing is not complete. |
