# Deploy on Railway [Host a Ponder app on Railway]

[Railway](https://railway.app)'s general-purpose cloud platform is a great starting point for most Ponder apps.

## Guide

::::steps

### Log in to Railway

Connect your GitHub account, and make sure that your Ponder app has been pushed to remote.

### Create a Ponder app service

From the Railway console:

1. Click **New Project** → **Deploy from GitHub repo** and select your repo from the list.
2. Click **Add variables**, then add RPC URLs (e.g. `PONDER_RPC_URL_1`) and other environment variables.
3. Create a public domain. In **Settings** → **Networking**, click **Generate Domain**.
4. Update the start command. In **Settings** → **Deploy**, set the **Custom Start Command** to include the `--schema` option. This is required to enable zero-downtime deployments. [Read more](/docs/0.10/database#database-schema).

:::code-group

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm start --schema $RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_ID
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn start --schema $RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_ID
```

```bash [npm]
npm run start -- --schema $RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_ID
```

:::

5. Set the healthcheck path and timeout. In **Settings** → **Deploy**, set the **Healthcheck Path** to `/ready` and the **Healthcheck Timeout** to `3600` seconds (1 hour, the maximum allowed).

:::info
_Monorepo users:_ Use the **Root Directory** and **Start Command** options
to run `ponder start` at the Ponder project root. For example, set the root directory
to `packages/ponder` or set the start command to `cd packages/ponder && pnpm start`.
:::

### Create a Postgres database

From the new project dashboard:

1. Click **Create** → **Database** → **Add PostgreSQL**
2. Open the **Variables** tab for the Ponder app service, click **New Variable** → **Add Reference** → select `DATABASE_URL` and click **Add**

::::

After a moment, the service running `ponder start` should redeploy successfully. Check the **Build Logs** and **Deploy Logs** tabs to debug any issues.
