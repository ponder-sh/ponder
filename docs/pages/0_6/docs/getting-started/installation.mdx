# Installation

The [create-ponder CLI tool](/docs/getting-started/new-project) is the best way to get started with Ponder. If it runs without error, your system meets the requirements.

## System requirements

- MacOS, Linux, or Windows
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) >=18 (support for Bun is [in progress](https://github.com/ponder-sh/ponder/issues/442))
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) (recommended), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install), or npm

### Windows

As of `0.4.7`, Ponder supports Windows via PowerShell, command prompt (cmd.exe), or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). If you encounter a Windows-specific problem, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ponder-sh/ponder/issues).

## TypeScript

Ponder uses advanced TypeScript features to offer end-to-end type safety without code generation.

<Callout type="info">
  We **strongly** recommend taking the time to set up a working TypeScript
  development environment. It will pay dividends in the long run.
</Callout>

### Requirements

- TypeScript `>=5.0.4` and viem `>=1.16.0`
- ABIs must be asserted `as const` following [ABIType guidelines](https://abitype.dev/guide/getting-started#usage).
- The `ponder-env.d.ts` file must be included in your project.

### `ponder-env.d.ts`

This "magical" file is what makes Ponder's zero-codegen type system possible. The file contains a module declaration for `"@/generated"{:ts}` that exports types derived from `ponder.config.ts` and `ponder.schema.ts`.

Occasionally, Ponder's dev server may make changes to `ponder-env.d.ts` after upgrading to a new version of `@ponder/core`. When this happens, please commit the changes into version control.

### VSCode

By default, VSCode's TypeScript language features use an internal version of TypeScript. Sometimes, this version does not meet Ponder's requirement of `>=5.0.4`.

To change VSCode's TypeScript version, run `TypeScript: Select TypeScript version..."` from the command palette and select `Use Workspace Version` or [update VSCode's version](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39668731/what-typescript-version-is-visual-studio-code-using-how-to-update-it).
