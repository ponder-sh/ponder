# Deploy

You can deploy your Ponder app to any cloud environment that supports Node.js.

- [Railway](#railway)
- [Self-hosting](#self-hosting)

## Railway

[Railway](https://railway.app)'s general-purpose cloud platform is a great starting point for most Ponder apps.

<Steps>

### Log in to Railway

Connect your GitHub account, and make sure that your Ponder app has been pushed to remote.

### Create a Ponder app service

From the Railway console:

1. Click **New Project** → **Deploy from GitHub repo** and select your repo from the list
2. Click **Add variables**, then add RPC URLs (e.g. `PONDER_RPC_URL_1`) and other environment variables
3. Create a public domain. In **Settings** → **Networking**, click **Generate Domain**
4. Set the healthcheck path and timeout. In **Settings** → **Deploy**, set the **Healthcheck Path** to `/ready` and the **Healthcheck Timeout** to `3600` seconds (1 hour)

<Callout type="warning">
  _Monorepo users:_ Configure the **Root Directory** and **Start Command** such
  that `ponder start` runs at the Ponder project root. For example, set the root
  directory to `packages/ponder` or set the start command to `cd packages/ponder
  && pnpm start`.
</Callout>

### Create a Postgres database

From the new project dashboard:

1. Click **Create** → **Database** → **Add PostgreSQL**
2. Open the **Variables** tab for the Ponder app service, click **New Variable** → **Add Reference** → select `DATABASE_URL` and click **Add**

After a moment, the Ponder app service should redeploy successfully. Check the **Build Logs** and **Deploy Logs** tabs to debug any issues.

</Steps>

## Self hosting

In general, hosting a Ponder app is similar to hosting a normal Node.js HTTP server. Rather than offer a step-by-step guide, this section describes the key Ponder-specific quirks to consider when self-hosting.

### Database connection

<Callout type="warning">
  You app will have performance issues if the roundtrip database latency exceeds
  ~20 milliseconds. This is common when using a database in different private
  network or region.
</Callout>

In production, Ponder works best with a Postgres database in the same private network. Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to the connection string of your Postgres database, or manually override the `database.connectionString` option in `ponder.config.ts`.

```ts filename="ponder.config.ts" {6}
import { createConfig } from "@ponder/core";

export default createConfig({
  database: {
    kind: "postgres",
    connectionString: "postgres://user:password@mycloud.internal:5432/database",
  },
  // ... more config
});
```

### Database schema

When a Ponder app starts up, it attempts to create user tables (defined in `ponder.schema.ts`) in the target schema. If another Ponder app is currently using that schema, the app will crash shortly after startup with the error `Schema 'public' is locked by a different Ponder app`. This locking mechanism avoids issues caused by two Ponder apps writing to the same tables simultaneously.

The default schema is `public`. This works fine during development, but causes problems in production when multiple deployments share the same database. During a zero-downtime redeployment, the new deployment will fail because the `public` schema is locked by the old deployment.

To avoid this problem, set the `schema` option in `ponder.config.ts` to a deployment-specific value. The best choice for `schema` depends on your environment - on Railway, Ponder automatically detects and uses the `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_ID` environment variable. In a Kubernetes cluster, the pod name is often a great choice:

<div class="code-columns">

```yaml filename="ponder.yaml" {17-21}
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: ponder-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: ponder
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: ponder
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: ponder
          # ...
          env:
            - name: POD_NAME
              valueFrom:
                fieldRef:
                  fieldPath: metadata.name
```

```ts filename="ponder.config.ts" {7}
import { createConfig } from "@ponder/core";

export default createConfig({
  database: {
    kind: "postgres",
    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    schema: process.env.POD_NAME,
  },
  // ... more config
});
```

</div>

### Health checks & probes

<Callout type="info">
  The `0.6` release added the `/ready` endpoint and simplified `/health`. Read
  the [migration guide](/docs/migration-guide#060).
</Callout>

Use the `/health` and `/ready` endpoints to configure health checks or [probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/liveness-readiness-startup-probes/).

- **`/health`**: Returns an HTTP `200` response immediately after the process starts.
- **`/ready`**: Returns an HTTP `200` response once indexing progress has reached realtime across all chains. During the historical backfill, the endpoint returns an HTTP `503` response.
