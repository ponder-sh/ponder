# Factory contracts

**Factory contracts** are a common smart contract design pattern where one contract (a "factory") creates many instances of another kind of contract (the "child" contract).

## Add a child contract

<Steps>

### Set the `factory` field in `ponder.config.ts`

Add the **child contract** to the `contracts` list in `ponder.config.ts`. Be sure to use the child contract name and ABI. Then, rather than setting an explicit `address` as you would for a normal contract, use the [`factory`](/api-reference/ponder-config#factory) option.

```ts filename="ponder.config.ts"
import type { Config } from "@ponder/core";
import { parseAbiItem } from "viem";

export const config: Config = {
  networks: [
    /* ... */
  ],
  contracts: [
    {
      name: "SudoswapPool",
      abi: "./abis/SudoswapPool.json",
      network: "mainnet",
      factory: {
        // The address of the factory contract that creates instances of this child contract.
        address: "0xb16c1342E617A5B6E4b631EB114483FDB289c0A4",
        // The event emitted by the factory that announces a new instance of this child contract.
        event: parseAbiItem("event NewPair(address poolAddress)"),
        // The name of the parameter that contains the address of the new child contract.
        parameter: "poolAddress",
      },
      startBlock: 14645816,
    },
  ],
};
```

### Register indexing functions

When you register an indexing function for a child contract event, that function will process events for **every** instance of that child contract. The `event.log.address` field contains the address of the specific child contract that emitted the event.

This indexing function will run for every `SudoswapPool` contract created by the factory.

```ts filename="src/index.ts"
import { ponder } from "@/generated";

ponder.on("SudoswapPool:Transfer", async ({ event }) => {
  // Here, `event.log.address` will vary depending on which
  // Sudoswap pool contract emitted this Transfer event.
  console.log(event.log.address);
});
```

</Steps>

## Requirements and limitations

### Scaling

Ponder does not currently support factory contracts with **more than 10,000 children.** This includes Uniswap V2, V3, and many other permisionless pool-based DeFi protocols.

Why not? The Ethereum JSON-RPC API does not scale well for factory contracts. There's only so much that Ponder's sync engine can do about this while remaining compatible with the JSON-RPC API.

<Callout type="warning">
  **A note from the developers:** We're actively working to address scaling
  challenges via features like remote sync, shared caching, concurrent indexing,
  and other fun tricks. Thanks for your patience.

### Factory event signature

Ponder only supports factory contracts where the following requirements are met:

1. The factory contract emits an event log announcing the creation of each new child contract.
2. The event log contains the new child contract address as a named parameter of type `"address"`. The parameter can be either indexed or non-indexed.

Here are a few factory event signatures with their eligibility explained:

```solidity
// ✅ Eligible. The parameter "child" has type "address" and is non-indexed.
event ChildContractCreated(address child);

// ✅ Eligible. The parameter "pool" has type "address" and is indexed.
event PoolCreated(address indexed deployer, address indexed pool, uint256 fee);

// ❌ Ineligible. The parameter "contracts" is an array type, which is not supported.
// Always emit a separate event for each child contract, even if they are created in a batch.
event ContractsCreated(address[] contracts);

// ❌ Ineligible. The parameter "child" is a struct/tuple, which is not supported.
struct ChildContract {
  address addr;
}
event ChildCreated(ChildContract child);
```

### Nested factory patterns

Ponder doesn't support factory patterns that are nested beyond a single layer.
