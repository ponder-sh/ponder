# Proxy contracts

Ponder supports [EIP-1967 proxy contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy) (Transparent and UUPS). Ponder handles proxy contracts by merging the ABI of the proxy contract with the ABI of the implementation contract.

The `create-ponder` Etherscan [contract link template](/api-reference/create-ponder#etherscan-contract-link) automatically detects proxy contracts and fetches all implementation contract ABIs.

<Callout type="info">
  To decode event logs emitted by a proxy contract, Ponder searches for a
  matching event in the implementation contract ABI(s). To avoid missing any
  events, make sure to include the ABI of every implementation contract that the
  proxy has ever had.
</Callout>

## Add a proxy contract

1. Find the implementation contract ABI (or ABIs) and paste each into a JSON file in the `abis/` directory. Tip: On Etherscan, there is a link to the implementation contract on the **Contract
   â†’ Read as Proxy** tab.

2. Add the implementation contract ABI to the contract's `abi` field in `ponder.config.ts`.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts filename="ponder.config.ts"
import type { Config } from "@ponder/core";

export const config: Config = {
  networks: [ /* ... */ ],
  contracts: [
    {
      name: "MyTokenContract",
      abi: [
        "./abis/MyTokenContract.json", // Proxy ABI
        "./abis/ERC1155.json" // Implementation ABI
      ],
      // ...
    }
  ]
};
```

3. Add event handlers for events defined in the implementation ABI. That's it!

```ts filename="src/index.ts"
import { ponder } from "@/generated";

ponder.on("MyTokenContract:TransferBatch", async ({ event }) => {
  // ...
});
```
