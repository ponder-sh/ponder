# Telemetry

As of version `0.0.79`, Ponder collects **completely anonymous** telemetry data about general usage. The developers use this data to prioritize new feature development, identify bugs, and improve performance & stability.

## Opt out

To opt out of telemetry, set the `PONDER_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` environment variable.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js filename=".env.local"
PONDER_TELEMETRY_DISABLED = true
```
