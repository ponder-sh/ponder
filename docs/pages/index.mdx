# Introduction

Ponder is an open-source framework for blockchain application backends. With Ponder, you can build a GraphQL API for any set of smart contracts on Ethereum-based blockchains with hot reloading, type safety, and easy deployment to production.

## Features

✅ &nbsp;Local development server with hot reloading<br/>
✅ &nbsp;`create-ponder` CLI tool to get started from an Etherscan link or Graph Protocol subgraph<br/>
✅ &nbsp;End-to-end type safety using [ABIType](https://github.com/wagmi-dev/abitype)<br/>
✅ &nbsp;Autogenerated GraphQL API (compatible with Graph Protocol subgraph schemas)<br/>
✅ &nbsp;Quickly deploy to [Railway](/guides/production), or anywhere using Node.js/Docker<br/>
✅ &nbsp;Native support for cross-chain apps<br/>
✅ &nbsp;Gracefully handles chain reorganizations<br/>
🏗️ &nbsp;Handle transactions calls (in addition to logs)<br/>
🏗️ &nbsp;Run effects (e.g. send an API request) in event handler code<br/>

## Example: ENS

<Callout type="info">
  Ponder is similar to Graph Protocol subgraphs. If you've built a subgraph

</Callout>

Let's use Ponder to build a GraphQL API that tracks ownership of Ethereum Name Service registrations.

The ENS `BaseRegistrar` contract emits a `NameRegistered` event every time a user registers a new ENS name. Here's the relevant snippet from that contract:

```solidity
contract BaseRegistrar {

    event NameRegistered(string name, address owner);

    function registerName(string calldata name, address owner) external {
        // ...
        emit NameRegistered(name, owner);
    }
}
```

<Steps>

### Ponder config

First we'll add `BaseRegistrar` as a contract in our Ponder config file. Ponder's indexing engine will now fetch all the events logs that have been emitted by the `BaseRegistrar` contract.

```ts filename="ponder.config.ts"
import { http } from "viem";
export const config = {
  networks: [
    {
      name: "mainnet",
      chainId: 1,
      transport: http("https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/..."),
    },
  ],
  contracts: [
    {
      name: "BaseRegistrar",
      network: "mainnet",
      abi: "./abis/BaseRegistrar.json",
      address: "0x57f1887a8BF19b14fC0dF6Fd9B2acc9Af147eA85",
      startBlock: 9380410,
    },
  ],
};
```

### GraphQL schema

Next we'll add an entity to our schema. The `schema.graphql` file defines the shape of the data that our GraphQL API will serve. Let's add an `EnsName` entity that stores the name, the owner's address, and a timestamp.

```graphql filename="schema.graphql"
type EnsName @entity {
  id: String!
  name: String!
  owner: String!
  registeredAt: Int!
}
```

### Event handler functions

Event handlers are TypeScript functions that process a blockchain event and insert data into the Entity store matching the GraphQL schema.

Here's an event handler to process the `NameRegistered` event. It inserts an `EnsName` entity into the store using the event parameters and the block timestamp.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts filename="src/EthereumNameService.ts"
import { ponder } from "@/generated";

ponder.on("BaseRegistrar:NameRegistered", async ({ event, context }) => {
  const { EnsName } = context.entities;
  const { name, owner } = event.params;

  await EnsName.create({
    id: `${name}-${owner}`,
    data: {
      name: name,
      owner: owner,
      registeredAt: event.block.timestamp
    }
  });
});
```

### GraphQL API

Now that we've inserted some data into the Entity store, we can query that data from the autogenerated GraphQL API:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```graphql filename="http://localhost:42069/graphql"
query GetEnsNames {
  ensNames(first: 2) {
    name
    owner
    registeredAt
  }
}
```

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```json filename="Result"
{
  "ensNames": [
    {
      "name": "vitalik.eth",
      "owner": "0x0904Dac3347eA47d208F3Fd67402D039a3b99859",
      "registeredAt": 1580345271
    },
    {
      "name": "joe.eth",
      "owner": "0x6109DD117AA5486605FC85e040ab00163a75c662",
      "registeredAt": 1580754710
    },
  ]
}
```

The GraphQL API includes useful features like pagination, sorting, and complex filters for each entity defined in `schema.graphql`.
